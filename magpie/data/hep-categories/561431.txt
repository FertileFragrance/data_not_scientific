Excited B and D mesons at OPAL
Two recent OPAL publications dealing with spectroscopy of heavy-light mesons will be discussed. In the charm sector, a search for a narrow radial excitation of the D*+- is performed. No signal is seen, and an upper limit of the production rate of narrow radial excitations close to the predicted mass of 2.629 GeV is derived. Orbitally excited B** mesons are investigated in another analysis, where for the first time a measurement of their branching ratio into final states involving a B* is performed. Attempts are made to separate the B** signal into the four contributing resonances.
