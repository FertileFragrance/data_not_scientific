Critical Point in a 3-3-1 Model with Right-Handed Neutrinos
The boson mass spectrum of a 3-3-1 model with right-handed neutrinos is investigated by tuning a unique free parameter whitin the exact algebraical approach for solving gauge models with high symmetries. A very strange coincidence of the masses in both the neutral and the charged boson sectors can occur at a not very high breaking scale. This could explain why the masses of the new bosons have not been exactly weighted in the laboratories by date. In order to have good phenomenological behaviour in the neutrino sector, one can resort to either the conservation of the global lepton number $L_{e}-L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}$ or see-saw mechanism.
