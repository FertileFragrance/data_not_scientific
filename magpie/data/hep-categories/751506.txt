Partial restoration of factorization and universality in presence of factorization breaking interactions in hadronic hard scattering processes
Recent works have discussed the violation of factorization and universality in hadronic hard scattering processes aimed at measurements of T-odd distributions. We use simple arguments to show that it is possible to restore an approximate factorization involving T-odd contributions if the factorization breaking interactions, after averaging their effect over undetected degrees of freedom, present an x-spectrum dominated by by a narrow and regular peak whose maximum value corresponds to a respected factorization.
