Observation of the Higgs Boson of strong interaction via Compton scattering by the nucleon
It is shown that the Quark-Level Linear $\sigma$ Model (QLL$\sigma$M) leads to a prediction for the diamagnetic term of the polarizabilities of the nucleon which is in excellent agreement with the experimental data. The bare mass of the $\sigma$ meson is predicted to be $m_\sigma=666$ MeV and the two-photon width $\Gamma(\sigma\to\gamma\gamma)=(2.6\pm 0.3)$ keV. It is argued that the mass predicted by the QLL$\sigma$M corresponds to the $\gamma\gamma\to\sigma\to NN$ reaction, i.e. to a $t$-channel pole of the $\gamma N\to N\gamma$ reaction. Large -angle Compton scattering experiments revealing effects of the $\sigma$ meson in the differential cross section are discussed. Arguments are presented that these findings may be understood as an observation of the Higgs boson of strong interaction while being part of the constituent quark.
