Scaling violations in Yang-Mills theories and strings in AdS(5)
String solitons in AdS_5 contain information of N=4 SUSY Yang-Mills theories on the boundary. Recent proposals for rotating string solitons reproduce the spectrum for anomalous dimensions of Wilson operators for the boundary theory. There are possible extensions of this duality for lower supersymmetric and even for non-supesymmetric Yang-Mills theories. We explicitly demonstrate that the supersymmetric anomalous dimensions of Wilson operators in N=0,1 Yang-Mills theories behave, for large spin J, at the two-loop level in perturbation theory, like log J. We compile the analytic one- and two-loop results for the N=0 case which is known in the literature, as well as for the N=1 case which seems to be missing.
