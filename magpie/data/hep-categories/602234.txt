A Simple model of generating fermion mass hierarchy in N=1 supersymmetric 6-d SO(10) GUT
We suggest simple models which produce the suitable fermion mass hierarchies and flavor mixing angles based on the 6 dimensional N=1 supersymmetric SO(10) grand unified theory compactified on a $T^2/(Z_2 \times Z_2')$ orbifold. We introduce 6D and 5D matter fields, which contains the 1st and 2nd generation matter fields as the zero modes, respectively. The 3rd generation matter fields are located on a 4D brane. The Yukawa couplings for bulk fields are suppressed by volume factors from extra dimensions. The suitable fermion mass hierarchies and flavor mixings are generated by the volume suppression factors.
