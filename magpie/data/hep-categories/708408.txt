The Fundamental symmetries in the neutral kaon system: A Pedagogical choice
During the recent years experiments with neutral kaons have yielded remarkably sensitive results which are pertinent to such fundamental phenomena as CPT invariance (protecting causality), time-reversal invariance violation, coherence of wave functions, and entanglement of kaons in pair states. We describe the phenomenological developments and the theoretical conclusions drawn from the experimental material. An outlook to future experimentation is indicated. An overview of formal similarities in fields outside neutral kaons is included.
