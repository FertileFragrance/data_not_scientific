Radiative decay of a scalar in a medium
Various processes which are forbidden in the vacuum by a combination of requirements, such as Lorentz and gauge invariance, can occur in the presence of a background medium. Here we consider the decay of a spin-0 particle into a photon and another spin-0 particle, which is forbidden in the vacuum due to angular momentum conservation, and show that it can occur in a medium even if the medium does not carry any angular momentum. We calculate the amplitude and determine the rate of the process in a simple model involving Yukawa interactions of the scalar particles with a charged fermion field.
