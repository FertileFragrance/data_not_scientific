A new class of stable $(2+1)$ dimensional thin shell wormhole
Recently, Ba\~{n}ados, Teitelboim and Zanelli (BTZ) \cite{BTZ1992} has discovered an explicit vacuum solution of (2+1)-dimensional gravity with negative cosmological constant. It has been argued that the existence of such physical systems with an event horizon and thermodynamic properties similar to (3+1) dimensional black holes. These vacuum solutions of (2+1)-dimensional gravity are asymptotically anti-de Sitter and are known as BTZ black holes. We provide a new type of thin-shell stable wormhole from the BTZ black holes. This is the first example of stable thin shell wormhole in (2+1)-dimension. Several characteristics of this thin-shell wormhole have been discussed.
