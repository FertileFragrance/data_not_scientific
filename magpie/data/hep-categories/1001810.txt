Effective matrix models for deconfinement in SU(N) and G(2) gauge theories
I present a simple matrix model for the deconfined phase of SU(N) theories at temperatures just above T(c). The model is designed to reproduce the anomaly, in particular the flatness of (e â 3p)/T(2) above ~ 1.2T(c) observed by lattice simulations with up to six colors. Furthermore, it predicts the existence of an adjoint Higgs phase where the masses of diagonal and off-diagonal gluons split and that the phase transition of SU(N) with three or more colors, and for exceptional groups with a trivial center such as G(2), is generically of first order. For G(2) gauge group, a small value of the Polyakov loop at T(â)(c) can be obtained with a non-perturbative potential summed over the roots of SU(7) rather than G(2), which implements the principle of maximal eigenvalue repulsion.
