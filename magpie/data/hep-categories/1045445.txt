Static BPS black holes in U(1) gauged supergravity
We consider the flow equations for $1/4$-BPS asymptotically AdS$_4$ static black holes in Fayet-Iliopoulos gauged supergravity, using very special geometry identities to obtain a simplified form in the most general case. Under mild assumptions on the form of the solution, we analyse the flow equations and find an explicit solution for arbitrary gauging and charge vectors within the chosen ansatz. Comparing with the corresponding attractor equations, we find that the solution is given in terms of exactly the same vector of parameters, implying that all regular attractors can be extended to full black hole solutions. We present explicit examples of black hole solutions with all complex scalars and charges allowed by the ansatz turned on, within the STU model and its truncations.
