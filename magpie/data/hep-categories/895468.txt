Cosmological Perturbation Analysis in a Scale Invariant Model of Gravity
We consider a model for gravity that is invariant under global scale transformations. It includes one extra real scalar field coupled non-minimally to the gravity fields. In this model all the dimensionful parameters like the gravitational constant and the cosmological constant etc. are generated by a solution of the classical equations of motion which breaks scale invariance. In this paper we demonstrate the stability of such a solution against small perturbations in a flat FRW background by making a perturbative expansion around this solution and solving the resulting equations linear in the perturbations.
