Higgs self coupling measurement in e+ e- collisions at center-of-mass energy of 500-GeV
Feasibility of the measurement of the trilinear self-couplings of the Higgs boson is studied. Such a measurement would experimentally determine the structure of the Higgs potential. Full hadronic and semi-leptonic final states of the double-Higgs strahlung have been investigated.
