G(2) Hitchin functionals at one loop
We consider the quantization of the effective target space description of topological M-theory in terms of the Hitchin functional whose critical points describe seven-manifolds with G2 structure. The one-loop partition function for this theory is calculated and an extended version of it, that is related to generalized G2 geometry, is compared with the topological G2 string. We relate the reduction of the effective action for the extended G2 theory to the Hitchin functional description of the topological string in six dimensions. The dependence of the partition functions on the choice of background G2 metric is also determined.
