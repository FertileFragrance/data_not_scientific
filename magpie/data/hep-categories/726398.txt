Particle Radiation From Gibbons-Maeda Black Hole
This paper investigates the particle radiation from Gibbons-Maeda black hole. Taking into account the self-gravitation of the particle, we calculate the tunnelling rate of the massless particle across the horizon, then we promote the work to the radiation of the charged particle. The calculations prove that the rate of tunnelling equals precisely the exponent of the difference of the black hole entropy before and after emission and the radiation spectrum deviates from exact thermal. The conclusion supports the viewpoint of information conservation.
