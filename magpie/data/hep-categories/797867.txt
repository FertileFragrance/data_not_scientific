A Note on conductivity and charge diffusion in holographic flavour systems
We analyze the charge diffusion and conductivity in a Dp/Dq holographic setup that is dual to a supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in p+1 dimensions with N_f<< N_c flavour degrees of freedom at finite temperature and nonvanishing U(1) baryon number chemical potential. We provide a new derivation of the results that generalize the membrane paradigm to the present context. We perform a numerical analysis in the particular case of the D3/D7 flavor system. The results obtained support the validity of the Einstein relation at finite chemical potential.
