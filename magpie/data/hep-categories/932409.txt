Indirect Dark Matter Searches and Models
Indirect dark matter searches are briefly reviewed. Current experimental data from satellites and Cherenkov telescopes searching for antimatter and gamma rays in galactic and extragalactic regions, are compared with predictions from theoretical models of dark matter. The analysis is focused on WIMPs such as the neutralino and the sneutrino, and a superWIMP such as the gravitino, in several interesting supersymmetric models. In particular, the discussion is carried out in the context of R-parity conserving models such as the MSSM, the NMSSM, and an extended NMSSM, and the R-parity violating model $\mu\nu$SSM.
