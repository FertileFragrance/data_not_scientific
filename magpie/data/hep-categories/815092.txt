Cosmology with interaction in the dark sector
Unless some unknown symmetry in Nature prevents or suppresses a non-minimal coupling in the dark sector, the dark energy field may interact with the pressureless component of dark matter. In this paper, we investigate some cosmological consequences of a general model of interacting dark matter-dark energy characterized by a dimensionless parameter $\epsilon$. We derive a coupled scalar field version for this general class of scenarios and carry out a joint statistical analysis involving SNe Ia data ({Legacy} and {Constitution} sets), measurements of baryon acoustic oscillation peak at $z = 0.20$ (2dFGRS) and $z = 0.35$ (SDSS), and measurements of the Hubble evolution $H(z)$. For the specific case of vacuum decay ($w = -1$), we find that, although physically forbidden, a transfer of energy from dark matter to dark energy is favored by the data.
