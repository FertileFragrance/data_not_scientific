Electromagnetic Fields of Slowly Rotating Compact Magnetized Stars in Braneworld
We study the structure of electromagnetic field of slowly rotating magnetized star in a Randall-Sundrum II type braneworld. The star is modeled as a sphere consisting of perfect highly magnetized fluid with infinite conductivity and frozen-in dipolar magnetic field. Maxwell's equations for the external magnetic field of the star in the braneworld are analytically solved in approximation of small distance from the surface of the star. We have also found numerical solution for the electric field outside the rotating magnetized neutron star in the braneworld in dependence on brane tension. The influence of brane tension on the electromagnetic energy losses of the rotating magnetized star is underlined. Obtained "brane" corrections are shown to be relevant and have non-negligible values. In comparison with astrophysical observations on pulsars spindown data they may provide an evidence for the brane tension and, thus, serve as a test for the braneworld model of the Universe.
