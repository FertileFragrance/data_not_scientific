Reply to `Comment to a paper of M. Villata on antigravity'
In this short paper we reply to the Comment [arXiv:1108.4543] by M. J. T. F. Cabbolet on Villata's theory of antigravity [arXiv:1103.4937]. The criticisms of methodological and ontological kind presented by that author come from a misinterpretation of some concepts, perhaps due to some lack of clarity or omission of details in Villata's original article. In order to clarify these points, here we provide additional explanations regarding the assumptions and results of the theory.
