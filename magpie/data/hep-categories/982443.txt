The measurement of branching ratio of B/s0 ---> D/s-+ K+- and B/s0 ---> D/s- pi+ in the LHCb experiment
The document reports the first observation of the Bs0 \rightarrow D\mp sK+- decays in the LHCb experiment together with the measurement of its branching fraction relative to the Cabibbo-favoured mode Bs0 \rightarrow D-s\pi +, {\frac{B(Bs0 \rightarrow D\mp sK+-)}{ B(Bs0 \rightarrow D-s\pi +)} = 0.0647+-0.0044({stat.})(+0.0039)-0.0043({syst.}). Furthermore, combining the yields obtained from 2010 data and the semileptonic LHCb measurements of the ratio of b-fragmentation fractions fs/fd, the branching fraction of the decay Bs0 \rightarrow D-s\pi + is calculated, B(Bs0 \rightarrow D-s\pi +)=(3.04 +-0.19({stat.})+-0.23({syst.})(+0.18)-0.16(fs/fd))10(-3). Finally, both measurements are used to obtain the absolute branching fraction of the Bs0 \rightarrow D\mp sK+- decay, B(Bs0 \rightarrow D\mp sK+-)=(1.97+-0.18({stat.})(+0.19)-0.20({syst.})(+0.11)-0.10(fs/fd ))10(-4). The branching fraction measurements are significantly more precise than the existing world average values. The analysis is based on a 370 pb(-1) data sample collected in 2011 at LHC.
