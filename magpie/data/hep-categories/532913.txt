General (anti-)de Sitter black holes in five-dimensions
We find a general class of rotating charged black hole solutions to N=2, D=5 gauged supergravity coupled to vector supermultiplets. The supersymmetry properties of these solutions are studied, and their mass and angular momenta are obtained. We also compute the stress tensor of the dual D=4, N=4 super Yang-Mills theory in the limit of strong `t Hooft coupling. It is shown that closed timelike curves occur outside the horizon, indicating loss of unitarity in the dual CFT. For imaginary coupling constant of the gravitini to the gauge fields, one can obtain multi-centered rotating charged de Sitter black holes. Some physical properties of these solutions are also discussed.
