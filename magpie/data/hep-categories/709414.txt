Towards a consistent estimate of the chiral low-energy constants
Guided by the large-Nc limit of QCD, we construct the most general chiral resonance Lagrangian that can generate chiral low-energy constants up to O(p^6). By integrating out the resonance fields, the low-energy constants are parametrized in terms of resonance masses and couplings. Information on those couplings and on the low-energy constants can be extracted by analysing QCD Green functions of currents both for large and small momenta. The chiral resonance theory generates Green functions that interpolate between QCD and chiral perturbation theory. As specific examples we consider the VAP and SPP Green functions.
