Quantum geometrodynamics: whence, whither?
Quantum geometrodynamics is canonical quantum gravity with the three-metric as the configuration variable. Its central equation is the Wheeler--DeWitt equation. Here I give an overview of the status of this approach. The issues discussed include the problem of time, the relation to the covariant theory, the semiclassical approximation as well as applications to black holes and cosmology. I conclude that quantum geometrodynamics is still a viable approach and provides insights into both the conceptual and technical aspects of quantum gravity.
