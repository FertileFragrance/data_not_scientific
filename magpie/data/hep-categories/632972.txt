Extension to the superWeyl-Kahler symmetry in anomaly mediation
Anomaly mediation mechanism of supersymmetry breaking is known to have an unsatisfactory aspect which is often referred to as the tachyonic slepton problem. A possible way out of this difficulty is investigated by considering the mediation mechanism not only of the super-Weyl but of K{\" a}hler part of anomaly. A new formula for the scalar mass squared is presented by including the effect of the K{\" a}hler anomaly. On the basis of the new formulae, the gauge non-singlet scalar mass squared is shown to be positive provided that the superpotential in the hidden sector satisfies a certain condition. The gauge singlet scalar mass squared may also be positive if we consider the threshold correction.
