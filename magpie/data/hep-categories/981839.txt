Search for heavy resonances decaying to tau pairs with the CMS detector at the Large Hadron Collider
A search for heavy resonance production decaying to tau pair is performed in the proton–proton collisions at the center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s} = 7$  TeV using 36 pb$^{ − 1}$ of data collected with CMS detector at the LHC during the year 2010. The number of observed events are in good agreement with the predictions of Standard Model background processes. Therefore, an upper limit on the resonance cross-section times the branching ratio to tau pair is obtained as a function of the resonance mass. Ditau resonance Z′ with Standard Model couplings having mass less than 468 GeV/c$^{2}$ is excluded at 95% confidence level.
