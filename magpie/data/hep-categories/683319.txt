Flow of geometries and instantons on the null orbifold
We study condensation of twisted sector states in the null orbifold geometry. As the singularity is time-dependent, we probe it using D-Instantons. We present evidence that the null-orbifold flows to the $Z_N$ orbifold. We also comment on the subtleties of quantizing the closed superstring in this background.
