Analysis of enhanced tan(beta) corrections in MFV GUT scenarios
We analyse a minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) taking a minimal flavour violation (MFV) structure at the GUT scale. We evaluate the parameters at the electroweak scale taking into account the full flavour structure in the evolution of the renormalization group equations. We concentrate mainly on the decay Bs -> mu mu and its correlations with other observables like b -> s gamma, b -> s l l, Delta M_Bs and the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. We restrict our analysis to the regions in parameter space consistent with the dark matter constraints. We find that the BR(Bs -> mu mu) can exceed the current experimental limit in the regions of parameter space which are allowed by all other constraints thus providing an additional bound on supersymmetric parameters. This holds even in the constrained MSSM. Assuming an hypothetical measurement of BR(Bs -> mu mu) ~ 10^-7 we analyse the predicted MSSM spectrum and flavour violating decay modes of supersymmetric particles which are found to be small.
