Neutrino oscillation as coupled vibration
Neutrino oscillation is visualized as coupled vibrations. Unlike existing models describing neutrino oscillations, our model involving a single fundamental mass parameter $m$ and first discussed in the context of a possible boson oscillation demonstrates that for a self consistent theory there should be three types of bosons paired with maximal mixing. The argument is easily extended to neutrinos (fermions) with the exception that in the case of boson oscillation means periodic variation of particle number, whereas in the case of fermions the particle number does not change, only the mass oscillates. The fermionic vacuum is not really empty but filled with zero energy fermions. The oscillation length calculated perturbatively conforms to the experimental findings. Also there is no fermionic number violation in our model.
