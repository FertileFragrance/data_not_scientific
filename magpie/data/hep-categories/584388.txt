Field localization in warped gauge theories
We present four-dimensional gauge theories that describe physics on five-dimensional curved (warped) backgrounds, which includes bulk fields with various spins (vectors, spinors, and scalars). Field theory on the AdS$_5$ geometry is examined as a simple example of our formulation. Various properties of bulk fields on this background, e.g., the mass spectrum and field localization behavior, can be achieved within a fully four-dimensional framework. Moreover, that gives a localization mechanism for massless vector fields. We also consider supersymmetric cases, and show in particular that the conditions on bulk masses imposed by supersymmetry on warped backgrounds are derived from a four-dimensional supersymmetric theory on the flat background. As a phenomenological application, models are shown to generate hierarchical Yukawa couplings. Finally, we discuss possible underlying mechanisms which dynamically realize the required couplings to generate curved geometries.
