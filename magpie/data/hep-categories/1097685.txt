Dark matter searches with asteroseismology
High-precision asteroseismic data provides an excellent opportunity to test theories of stellar evolution and new physics, such as the properties of the dark matter (DM) of the Universe. Here we will show that some models of DM lead to changes in the classical scenario of stellar evolution. The accumulation of DM in the core of low-mass stars reduces their central temperatures and inhibits the formation of small convective cores in 1.1-1.3 Ms stars. We review the asteroseismic constraints that have been set to the characteristics of the DM particles, obtained comparing the oscillations of the star Alpha Cen B with modified stellar models. To conclude, we discuss the prospects to use CoRoT and Kepler data on main-sequence stars and red giants to further constrain the nature of DM.
