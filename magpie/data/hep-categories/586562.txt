Generalized Boltzmann equations for on-shell particle production in a hot plasma
A novel refinement of the conventional treatment of Kadanoff--Baym equations is suggested. Besides the Boltzmann equation another differential equation is used for calculating the evolution of the non-equilibrium two-point function. Although it was usually interpreted as a constraint on the solution of the Boltzmann equation, we argue that its dynamics is relevant to the determination and resummation of the particle production cut contributions. The differential equation for this new contribution is illustrated in the example of the cubic scalar model. The analogue of the relaxation time approximation is suggested. It results in the shift of the threshold location and in smearing out of the non-analytic threshold behaviour of the spectral function. Possible consequences for the dilepton production are discussed.
