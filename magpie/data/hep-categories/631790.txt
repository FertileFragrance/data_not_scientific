Quasiparticle description of the hot and dense quark gluon plasma
The collective modes of QCD at temperatures and densities above its phase-transition are analyzed for isotropic systems as well as for systems having an anisotropy in momentum-space using the HTL approximation. For isotropic systems, results for the thermodynamic pressure and entropy at finite densities based on a phenomenological description of lattice calculations at vanishing densities are derived and compared to those following from different methods. From the resulting equation of state the mass-radius relationship of so-called quark-stars and other applications are investigated. It is shown that systems with anisotropic momentum-space distributions contain unstable modes in addition to the stable quasiparticle modes, which may be of great importance for the dynamical evolution of an incompletely thermalized quark-gluon plasma. Finally, the effects of the anisotropy on the collisional energy loss are studied.
