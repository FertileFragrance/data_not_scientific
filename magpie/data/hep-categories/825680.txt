A New search for anomalous neutrino oscillations at the CERN-PS
The LSND experiment has observed a 3.8 sigma excess of anti-nu_e events from an anti-nu_mu beam coming from pions at rest. If confirmed, the LSND anomaly would imply new physics beyond the standard model, presumably in the form of some additional sterile neutrinos. The MiniBooNE experiment at FNAL-Booster has further searched for the LSND anomaly. Above 475 MeV, the nu_e result is excluding the LSND anomaly to about 1.6 sigma but it introduces an unexplained, new 3.0 sigma anomaly at lower energies, down to 200 MeV. The nu_e data have so far an insufficient statistics to be conclusive with LSND's anti-nu_e. The present proposal at the CERN-PS is based on two strictly identical LAr-TPC detectors in the near and far positions, respectively at 127 and 850 m from the neutrino (or antineutrino) target and focussing horn, observing the electron-neutrino signal. This project will benefit from the already developed technology of ICARUS T600, well tested on surface in Pavia, without the need of any major R&D activity and without the added problems of an underground experiment (CNGS-2). The superior quality of the Liquid Argon imaging TPC and its unique electron - pi-zero discrimination allow full rejection of the NC background, without efficiency loss for electron neutrino detection. In two years of exposure, the far detector mass of 600 tons and a reasonable utilization of the CERN-PS with the refurbished previous TT7 beam line will allow to collect about 10^6 charged current events, largely adequate to settle definitely the LSND anomaly.
