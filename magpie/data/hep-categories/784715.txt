Radiative correction to the lightest neutral Higgs mass in warped supersymmetry
We compute radiative correction to the lightest neutral Higgs mass ($m_h$) induced by the Kaluza-Klein (KK) towers of fermions and sfermions in a minimal supersymmetric scenario embeded in a 5-dimensional warped space. The Higgs is confined to the TeV brane. The KK spectra of matter supermultiplets is tied to the explanation of the fermion mass hierarchy problem. We demonstrate that for a reasonable choice of extra-dimensional parameters, the KK-induced radiative correction can enhance the upper limit on $m_h$ by as much as 100 GeV beyond the 4d limit of 135 GeV.
