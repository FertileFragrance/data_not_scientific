On the consistency relation of the 3-point function in single field inflation
The consistency relation for the 3-point function of the CMB is a very powerful observational signature which is believed to be true for every inflationary model in which there is only one dynamical degree of freedom. Its importance relies on the fact that deviations from it might be detected in next generation experiments, allowing us to rule out all single field inflationary models. After making more precise the already existing proof of the consistency relation, we use a recently developed effective field theory for inflationary perturbations to provide an alternative and very explicit proof valid at leading non trivial order in slow roll parameters.
