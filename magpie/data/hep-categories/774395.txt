Why Don't We See the Hagedorn Mass Spectrum in the Experiments?
The medium dependent finite width is introduced into an exactly solvable model with the general mass-volume spectrum of the QGP bags. The hard core repulsion between the bags is accounted for. The model allows us to estimate the minimal value of the QGP bags' width from the lattice QCD data and get that the resonance width at zero temperature is above 587 MeV, whereas the resonance width at the Hagedorn temperature is above 2034 MeV. The large width of the QGP bags not only explains the observed deficit in the number of hadronic resonances, but also clarifies the reason why the heavy QGP bags cannot be directly observed as metastable states in a hadronic phase.
