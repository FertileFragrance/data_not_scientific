On the Dalitz plot analysis of the B ---> K eta gamma decays
Recently B-factories have published new results on the $B \to K \eta \gamma$ decays being inspired by the theoretical suggestion to search for new physics in $B \to P_1 P_2 \gamma$ decays. Using heavy meson chiral perturbation theory we find mechanism which explains contribution in parts of the Dalitz plots where either $K$ or $\eta$ mesons are soft. The dominant contributions in these cases are coming from the nonresonant decay modes. We discuss also $B \to K \eta' \gamma$ Dalitz plot. Our results are in agreement with the experimental findings, making the presence of new physics rather unlikely.
