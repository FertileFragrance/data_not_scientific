Spin--3/2 to spin--1/2 heavy baryons and pseudoscalar mesons transitions in QCD
The strong coupling constants of light pseudoscalar mesons with spin--3/2 and spin--1/2 heavy baryons are calculated in the framework of light cone QCD sum rules. It is shown that each class of transitions among members of the sextet spin--3/2 to sextet spin--1/2 baryons and that of the sextet spin--3/2 to spin--1/2 anti--triplet baryons is described by only one invariant function. We also estimate the widths of kinematically allowed transitions. Our results on decay widths are in good agreement with the existing experimental data, as well as predictions of other nonperturbative approaches.
