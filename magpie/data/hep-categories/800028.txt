A Quirky Little Higgs Model
We consider an extra dimensional model where the quadratically divergent top loop contribution to the Higgs mass is cancelled by an uncolored heavy 'top quirk' charged under a different SU(3) gauge group. The cancellation is enforced by bulk gauge symmetries. Thus we have an unusual type of little Higgs model which has some quirky signatures. The top partner in this model could be identified at the Large Hadron Collider due to macroscopic strings that connect quirk and anti-quirks. The model can undergo radiative electroweak symmetry breaking and is consistent with precision electroweak measurements.
