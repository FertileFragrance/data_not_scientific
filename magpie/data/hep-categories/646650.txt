Problems of vacuum energy and dark energy
A simple description of the vacuum energy (cosmological constant) problem for non-experts is presented. Basic features of cosmology with non-zero vacuum energy are discussed. The astronomical data which indicate that the universe is filled with an anti-gravitating state of matter are described. The mechanisms which may lead to cancellation of almost infinite vacuum energy down to the astronomically observed value are discussed. The idea of dynamical adjustment is considered in some more detail.
