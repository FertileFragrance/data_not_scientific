Precise charm-quark mass from deep-inelastic scattering
We present a determination of the charm-quark mass in the MS@? scheme using the data combination of charm production cross section measurements in deep-inelastic scattering at HERA. The framework of global analyses of the proton structure accounts for all correlations of the charm-quark mass with the other non-perturbative parameters, most importantly the gluon distribution function in the proton and the strong coupling constant @a_s(M_Z). We obtain at next-to-leading order in QCD the value m_c(m_c)=1.15+/-0.04(exp)_-_0_._0_0^+^0^.^0^4(scale) GeV and at approximate next-to-next-to-leading order m_c(m_c)=1.24+/-0.03(exp)_-_0_._0_2^+^0^.^0^3(scale)_-_0_._0_7^+^0^.^0^0(theory) GeV with an accuracy competitive with other methods.
