Constraints on the range lambda of Yukawa-like modifications to the Newtonian inverse-square law of gravitation from Solar System planetary motions
In this paper we use the latest corrections to the Newton-Einstein secular perihelion rates of some planets of the Solar System, phenomenologically estimated with the EPM2004 ephemerides by the Russian astronomer E.V. Pitjeva, to put severe constraints on the range parameter lambda characterizing the Yukawa-like modifications of the Newtonian inverse-square law of gravitation. It turns out that the range cannot exceed about one tenth of an Astronomical Unit. We assumed neither equivalence principle violating effects nor spatial variations of $\alpha$ and $\lambda$. This finding may have important consequences on all the modified theories of gravity involving Yukawa-type terms with range parameters much larger than the Solar System size. However, caution is advised since we, currently have at our disposal only the periehlion extra-rates estimated by Pitjeva: if and when other groups will estimate their own corrections to the secular motion of perihelia, more robust and firm tests may be conducted.
