A simple solution to color confinement
We show that color confinement is a direct result of the nonabelian, i.e. nonlinear, nature of the color interaction in quantum chromodynamics. This makes it in general impossible to describe the color field as a collection of elementary quanta (gluons). A quark cannot be an elementary quanta of the quark field, as the color field of which it is the source is itself a source hence making isolated (noninteracting) quarks impossible. In geometrical language, the impossibility of quarks and gluons as physical particles arises due to the fact that the color Yang-Mills space does not have a constant trivial curvature.
