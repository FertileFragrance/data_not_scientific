An Introduction to the generalized parton distributions
The concepts of Generalized Parton Distributions (GPD) are reviewed in an introductory and phenomenological fashion. These distributions provide a rich and unifying picture of the nucleon structure. Their physical meaning is discussed. The GPD are in principle measurable through exclusive deeply virtual production of photons (DVCS) or of mesons (DVMP). Experiments are starting to test the validity of these concepts. First results are discussed and new experimental projects presented, with an emphasis on this program at Jefferson Lab.
