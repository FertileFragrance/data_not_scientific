A Model of TeV Scale Physics for Neutrino Mass, Dark Matter and Baryon Asymmetry and its Phenomenology
We discuss some details for the model proposed in Ref. \cite{aks-prl}, in which neutrino oscillation, dark matter, and baryon asymmetry of the Universe can be simultaneously explained by the TeV-scale physics without introducing very high mass scales. An exact discrete $Z_2$ symmetry is introduced, under which new particle contents (a real singlet scalar field, a pair of charged singlet scalar fields and TeV-scale right-handed neutrinos) are assigned to have odd quantum number, whereas ordinary gauge fields, quarks and leptons, and two Higgs doublets are even. Tiny neutrino masses are generated at the three loop level due to the exact $Z_2$ symmetry, by which stability of the dark matter candidate is also guaranteed. The extra Higgs doublet is required not only for the tiny neutrino masses but also for successful electroweak baryogenesis. We discuss phenomenological properties of the model, and find that there are successful scenarios in which above three problems are solved simultaneously under the constraint from current experimental data. We then discuss predictions in such scenarios at ongoing and future experiments. It turns out that the model provides discriminative predictions especially in Higgs physics and dark matter physics, so that it is testable in near future.
