Past Eras In Cyclic Cosmological Models
In infinitely cyclic cosmology past eras are discussed using set theory and transfinite numbers. One consistent scenario, already in the literature, is where there is always a countably infinite number, $\aleph_0$, of universes and no big bang. I describe here an alternative where the present number of universes is $\aleph_0$ and in the infinite past there was only a finite number of universes. In this alternative model it is also possible that there was no big bang.
