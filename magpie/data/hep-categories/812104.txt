Mass-spin relation for quark anti-quark bound states in non-commutative Yang-Mills theory
We construct a semi-classical steady state configuration of open strings ending on D3-brane embedded into type IIB $AdS_5 \times S_5$ background. These states are interpretable as positronium-like bound state of spinning W/anti-W pair in $SU(N+1) \to SU(N) \times U(1)$ theory. We find a tower of excited bound states which are stable in the large $N$, large 't Hooft coupling limit of the theory. We also extend our analysis to the case with non-vanishing non-commutativity parameter. We find that the relation between they energy and the angular momentum of the bound state is unaffected by the non-commutativity parameter even though the physical configuration of the open string is modified drastically.
