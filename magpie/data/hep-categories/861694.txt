Semiinclusive DIS cross sections and spin asymmetries in the quantum statistical parton distributions approach
We consider the extension of the statistical parton distributions to include their transverse momentum dependence, by using two different methods, one is based on our quantum statistical approach, the other on a relativistic covariant method. We take into account the effects of the Melosh-Wigner rotation for the polarized distributions. The results obtained can be compared with recent semiinclusive Deep Inelastic Scattering data on the cross section and double longitudinal-spin asymmetries from JLab. We also give some predictions for future experiments on electron-neutron scattering.
