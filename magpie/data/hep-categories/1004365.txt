Strange hadrons at intermediate and high transverse momentum in p+p, d+Au, Cu + Cu and Au + Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV measured with PHENIX detector
The PHENIX experiment provides excellent capabilities to measure particles containing s/sbar quarks in a wide transverse momentum (p_T) range using a combination of different analysis techniques. In this article, we present latest PHENIX result on production of K^+/-,K_s,K^@? and @f at intermediate and high p_T in p+p, d+Au, Cu + Cu and Au + Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200 GeV. The nuclear modification factors are obtained for d+Au and heavy ion collisions at different centralities covering a wide range of transverse momenta. The systematic study of these mesons improve the understanding of the strange meson production and their difference from light hadrons.
