Azimuthal Angle Probe of Anomalous $HWW$ Couplings at a High Energy $ep$ Collider
A high energy ep collider, such as the proposed LHeC, possesses the unique facility of permitting direct measurement of the HWW coupling without contamination from the HZZ coupling. At such a machine, the fusion of two W bosons through the HWW vertex would give rise to typical charged current (CC) events accompanied by a Higgs boson. We demonstrate that azimuthal angle correlations between the observable CC final states could then be a sensitive probe of the nature of the HWW vertex and hence of the CP properties of the Higgs boson.
