The evaluation of V(ud) and its impact on the unitarity of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa quark-mixing matrix
The determination of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix element V(ud) is reviewed. Data from 0(+) -> 0(+) superallowed beta decay in nuclei, neutron decay, beta decay of odd-mass mirror nuclei and pion beta decay are considered. Theoretic al radiative and isospin-symmetry breaking corrections are applied. The most precise result comes from the nuclear 0(+) -> 0(+) decays, which yield a recommended value of |V(ud)| = 0.974 25(22). We further summarize the data leading to the CKM matrix el ement V(us): Kell(3) decays, Kell(2) decays, hyperon decays and hadronic tau decay. Again SU(3)-symmetry breaking corrections (from lattice QCD) and radiative corrections are applied. We adopt values from Kell(3) decay of |V(us)| = 0.2246(12) and from Kel l(2) decay of |V(us)/V(ud)| = 0.2319(14). From the three data just cited, a least squares fit determines two CKM matrix elements: |V(ud)| = 0.974 25(22) and |V(us)| = 0.225 21(94). Data leading to the third member of the top row of the CKM matrix, V(ub), are summarized as well but, being of order 10(-')(3), that matrix element contributes negligibly to the unitarity sum, |V(ud)|(2) + |V(us)|(2) + |V(ub)|(2). We find this sum to be 0.999 90(60) showing unitarity to be satisfied to a precision of 0.06%. We discuss the constraints this result places on selected extensions to the standard model.
