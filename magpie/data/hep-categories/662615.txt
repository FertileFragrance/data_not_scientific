Rolling down the throat in NS5-brane background: The Case of electrified D-brane
We study rolling radion dynamics of electrified D-brane in NS5-brane background, both in effective field theory and in full open string theory. We construct exact boundary states and, from them, extract conserved Noether currents. We argue that T-duality and Lorentz boost offer an intuitive approach. In the limit of large number of NS5-branes, both boundary wave functions and conserved currents are sharply peaked and agree with those deduced from the effective field theory. As the number of NS5-branes is reduced, width around the peak becomes wider by string corrections. We also study radiative decay process. By applying Lorentz covariance, we show how the decay of electrified D-brane is related to that of bare D-brane. We compute spectral moments of final state energy and winding quantum number. Using Lorentz covariance argument, we explain in elementary way why winding quantum number should be included and derive rules how to do so. We conclude that Kutasov's geometric realization between radion rolling dynamics and tachyon rolling dynamics holds universally, both for bare and electrified D-branes.
