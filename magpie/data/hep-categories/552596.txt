Kaluza-Klein theories and the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon
We discuss nonminimal couplings of fermions to the electromagnetic field, which generically appear in models with extra dimensions. We consider models where the electromagnetic field is generated by the Kaluza-Klein mechanism. The nonminimal couplings contribute at tree-level to anomalous magnetic and electric dipole moments of fermions. We use recent measurements of these quantities to put limits on the parameters of models with extra dimensions.
