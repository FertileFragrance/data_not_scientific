QCD at high-energy (experiments)
Recent measurements of QCD interactions involving large momentum transfers are reviewed. The status of measurements of the strong coupling constant is summarised. Recent developments in the measurement and interpretation of deep inelastic scattering, proton-anti-proton collisions and two-photon processes are discussed. While QCD at next-to-leading order gives a qualitative description of many processes, next-to-NLO calculations are now required to allow quantitative information to be extracted from hadron-initiated multijet data. This is illustrated by a discussion of recent data on the photoproduction of dijet events at HERA.
