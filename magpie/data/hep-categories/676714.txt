Mass spectra of excited meson states consisting of u-, d-quarks and antiquarks
Mass spectra of excited meson states consisting of u-, d-quarks and antiquarks with I = 1 are considered. The comparison between the existing experimental data and the mass values evaluated with phenomenological formulae is carried out. Problems of identification of vector and scalar meson excited states are discussed.
