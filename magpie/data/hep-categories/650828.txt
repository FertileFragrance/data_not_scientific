Dark energy and modified gravities
We review the several models of the dark energy, which may generate the accelerated expansion of the present universe. We also discuss the the Big Rip singularity, which may occur when the equation of the state parameter w is less than -1. We show that the quantum correction would be very important near the singularity.
