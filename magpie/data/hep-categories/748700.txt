LHC and dark matter signals of improved naturalness
The Standard Model Higgs suffers from the hierarchy problem, typically implying new states within the reach of the LHC. If the Higgs is very heavy (~500 GeV) the states that cutoff the quadratic divergence may be beyond the reach of the LHC. However, in this case precision electroweak data require the Standard Model to be augmented with new states at the electroweak scale. We study a very simple model, with no new colored states, that allows a heavy Higgs whilst remaining consistent with experiments, and yielding the correct dark matter abundance. We investigate the possibilities for its discovery at the LHC and future dark matter detection experiments.
