Fundamental physics in space with the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope
Successfully launched in June 2008, the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, formerly named GLAST, has been observing the high-energy gamma-ray sky with unprecedented sensitivity for more than two years, opening a new window on a wide variety of exotic astrophysical objects. This paper is a short overview of the main science highlights, aimed at non-specialists, with emphasis on those which are more directly connected with the study of fundamental physics---particularly the search for signals of new physics in the diffuse gamma-ray emission and in the cosmic radiation and the study of Gamma-Ray Burst as laboratories for testing possible violations of the Lorentz invariance.
