Rationality, quasirationality and finite W-algebras
Some of the consequences that follow from the C_2 condition of Zhu are analysed. In particular it is shown that every conformal field theory satisfying the C_2 condition has only finitely many n-point functions, and this result is used to prove a version of a conjecture of Nahm, namely that every representation of such a conformal field theory is quasirational. We also show that every such vertex operator algebra is a finite W-algebra, and we give a direct proof of the convergence of its characters as well as the finiteness of the fusion rules.
