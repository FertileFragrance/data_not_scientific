D(s) Inclusive Decays
The availability of branching fractions for a large majority of $D_s$ decays permits the prediction of inclusive branching fractions. This is achieved with the help of a modest amount of input from an isospin statistical model applied to non-resonant multibody $D_s$ decays. A systematic uncertainty in these mostly small branching ratios is estimated by comparing predictions of this model with those of a model involving quark-antiquark pair production. The calculated inclusive branching fractions can be compared with data (for example, from a large sample of $D_s^+ D_s^{*-} + D_s^{*+} D_s^-$ obtained by the CLEO Collaboration) and examined for specific final states which can shed light on strong and weak decay mechanisms.
