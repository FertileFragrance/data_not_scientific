Phenomenological study of solar neutrino induced double beta process of Mo-100
The detection of solar-neutrinos of different origin via induced beta beta process of Mo100 is investigated. The particular counting rates and energy distributions of emitted electrons are presented. A discussion in respect to solar-neutrino detector consisting of 10 tones of Mo100 is included. Both the cases of the standard solar model and neutrino oscillation scenarios are analyzed. Moreover, new beta^- beta^+ and beta^-/EC channels of the double-beta process are introduced and possibilities of their experimental observation are addressed.
