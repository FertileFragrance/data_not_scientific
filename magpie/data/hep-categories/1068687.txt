Searches with Boosted Objects
Boosted objects - particles whose transverse momentum is greater than twice their mass - are becoming increasingly important as the LHC continues to explore energies in the TeV range. The sensitivity of searches for new phenomena beyond the Standard Model depends critically on the efficient reconstruction and identification (tagging) of their unique detector signatures. This contribution provides a review of searches for new physics carried out by the ATLAS and CMS experiments that rely on the reconstruction and identification of boosted top quarks as well as boosted $W$, $Z$ and Higgs bosons. A particular emphasis is placed on the different substructure techniques and tagging algorithms for top quarks and bosons employed by the two experiments.
