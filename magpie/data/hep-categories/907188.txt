Spontaneous Breaking of Lorentz Symmetry by Ghost Condensation in Perturbative Quantum Gravity
In this paper we will study the spontaneous breakdown of the Lorentz symmetry by ghost condensation in perturbative quantum gravity. Our analysis will be done in the Curci-Ferrari gauge. We will also analyse modification of the BRST and the anti-BRST transformations by the formation of this ghost condensate. It will be shown that even though the modified BRST and the modified anti-BRST transformations are not nilpotent, their nilpotency is restored on-shell.
