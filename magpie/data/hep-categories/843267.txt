Charged Black Holes and Constraints on Baryon Asymmetry
The no-hair theorem, which postulates that all black holes can be completely characterized by only three externally observable parameters: mass, electric charge, and angular momentum, sets constraints on both the maximal angular momentum and maximal electric charge. In this work, we would explore the consequence of these for the formation of primordial black holes in the early universe and also the formation of black holes due to collapse of dark matter configurations and how this could be used to probe the conditions in the very early universe and constrain the epoch when baryon asymmetry was established.
