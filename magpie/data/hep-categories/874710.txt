Scalar field models of dark energy with barotropic equation of state: properties and observational constraints from different datasets
The possibility of constraining the parameters of scalar field dark energy with barotropic equation of state using different available datasets is discussed. It has been found that the initial value of dark energy equation of state parameter is constrained very weakly by most of the data. We have determined the constraints on this parameter, which come from the combined dataset including supernovae from the full SDSS compilation with the MLCS2k2 fitting of light curves. We discuss also the possibility of distinguishing between different dark energy models with barotropic equation of state using the future data on CMB anisotropies.
