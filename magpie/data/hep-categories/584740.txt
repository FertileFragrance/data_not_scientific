Neutrino large mixing in universal Yukawa coupling model with small violation
We have analyzed the possibility that the universal Yukawa coupling (democratic mass matrix) with small violations of Dirac and Majorana neutrinos can induce the large mixing of neutrinos through the seesaw mechanism. The possibility can be achieved by the condition that the violation parameters of Majorana neutrinos are sufficiently smaller than the violation parameters of Dirac neutrinos. Allowed regions of the violation parameters producing the observed neutrino mass hierarchy and large neutrino mixing are not so restricted at present in contrast to the violation parameters for quark sector.
