Generalized Nariai Solutions for Yang-type Monopoles
A detailed study of the geometries that emerge by a gravitating generalized Yang monopole in even dimensions is carried out. In particular, those which present black hole and cosmological horizons. This two-horizon system is thermally unstable. The process of thermalization will drive both horizons to coalesce. This limit is what is profusely studied in this paper. It is shown that eventhough coordinate distance shrinks to zero, physical distance does not. So, there is some remaining space which geometry has been computed and identified as a generalized Nariai solution. The thermal properties of this new spacetime are then calculated. Topics, as the elliptical relation between radii of spheres in the geometry or a discussion about whether a mass-type term should be present in the line element or not, are also included.
