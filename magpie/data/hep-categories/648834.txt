Exact black hole solution with a minimally coupled scalar field
An exact four-dimensional black hole solution of gravity with a minimally coupled self-interacting scalar field is reported. The event horizon is a surface of negative constant curvature enclosing the curvature singularity at the origin, and the scalar field is regular everywhere outside the origin. This solution is an asymptotically locally AdS spacetime. The strong energy condition is satisfied on and outside the event horizon. The thermodynamical analysis shows the existence of a critical temperature, below which a black hole in vacuum undergoes a spontaneous dressing up with a nontrivial scalar field in a process reminiscent of ferromagnetism.
