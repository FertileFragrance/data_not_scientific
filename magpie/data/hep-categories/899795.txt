Late and early time phenomenology of Higgs-dependent cutoff
The analysis of theories with non-minimal coupling of Higgs field to gravity revealed that they enter into strong coupling regime above certain Higgs-dependent cutoff, which may be considerably below the Planck scale. Assuming that the effective theory, complementing the Standard Model or its minimal extension--the nuMSM--contains a set of higher dimensional operators suppressed by the Higgs-dependent cutoff, we analyse the reheating of the Universe after the Higgs inflation. We show that extra terms do not spoil the Higgs inflation, but can lead to baryogenesis and to warm sterile neutrino dark matter production at the reheating stage of the Universe expansion. They can also result in neutrino mass generation and proton decay.
