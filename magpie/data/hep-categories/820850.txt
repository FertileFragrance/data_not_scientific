Radiative corrections to the Higgs potential in the LH model
In this work we compute the radiative corrections to the Higgs mass and the Higgs quartic couplings coming from the Higgs sector itself and the scalar fields $\phi$ in the Littlest Higgs (LH) model. The restrictions that the new contributions set on the parameter space of the models are also discussed. Finally this work, together with our three previous papers, complete our program addressed to compute the relevant contributions to the Higgs low-energy effective potential in the LH model and the analysis of their phenomenological consequences.
