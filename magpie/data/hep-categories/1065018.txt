Higgsino Dark Matter in High-Scale Supersymmetry
We study a supersymmetric (SUSY) Standard Model in which a Higgsino is light enough to be dark matter, while the other SUSY particles are much heavier than the weak scale. We carefully treat the effects of heavy SUSY particles to the Higgsino nature, especially taking into account the renormalization effects due to the large hierarchy between the Higgsino and the SUSY breaking scales. Inelastic scattering of the Higgsino dark matter with a nucleus is studied, and the constraints on the scattering by the direct detection experiments are discussed. This gives an upper limit on the new physics scale. Bounds on the dark matter-nucleon elastic scattering, the electric dipole moments, and direct production of Higgsinos, on the other hand, give a lower limit. We show the current status on the limits and discuss the future prospects.
