A Departure from prediction: Electroweak physics at NuTeV
The NuTeV experiment has performed precision measurements of the ratio of neutral-current to charged-current cross-sections in high rate, high energy neutrino and anti-neutrino beams on a dense, primarily steel, target. The separate neutrino and anti-neutrino beams, high statistics, and improved control of other experimental systematics, allow the determination of electroweak parameters with significantly greater precision than past neutrino-nucleon scattering experiments. Our null hypothesis test of the standard model prediction measures sin2thetaW=0.2277+/-0.0013(stat)+/-0.0009(syst), a value which is 3.0 standard deviations above the prediction. We discuss possible explanations for and implications of this discrepancy.
