Probing New Physics via pp-> W+W- -> lvjj at the CERN LHC
TeV scale new Physics, e.g., Large Extra Dimensions or Models with anomalous triple vector boson couplings, can lead to excesses in various kinematic regions on the semi-leptonic productions of pp -> WW -> lvjj at the CERN LHC, which, although suffers from large QCD background compared with the pure leptonic channel, can benefit from larger production rates and the reconstructable 4-body mass Mlvjj. We study the search sensitivity through the lvjj channel at the 7TeV LHC on relevant new physics, via probing the hard tails on the reconstructed Mlvjj and the transverse momentum of W-boson (PTW), taking into account main backgrounds and including the parton shower and detector simulation effects. Our results show that with integrated luminosity of 5fb-1, the LHC can already discovery or exclude a large parameter region of the new physics, e.g., 95% CL. limit can be set on the Large Extra Dimensions with a cut-off scale up to 1.5 TeV, and the WWZ anomalous coupling down to, e.g. |\lambda_Z|~0.1. Brief results are also given for the 8TeV LHC.
