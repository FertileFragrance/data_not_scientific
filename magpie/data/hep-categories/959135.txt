Charmed Scalar Meson Production in $B$ Decays
The study on the charmed scalar meson spectroscopy has become a hot topic both experimentally and theoretically. The $B_{(s)}$ decays provide an ideal place to study their property. We employ the $B$-meson light-cone sum rules to compute the $\bar B_s^0\to D_s^{*+}(2317)$ and $B^-\to D_0^{*0}(2400)$ transition form factors at large recoil, assuming $D_s^{*+}(2317)$ and $D_0^{*0}(2400)$ being scalar quark-anti-quark states. The results are extrapolated to the whole momentum region with the help of HQET. Considering large uncertainties, our results can be consistent with the previous studies, while the power corrections should be large. We also estimate the semi-leptonic decays $\bar B_s^0\to D_s^{*+}(2317)l \bar{\nu}_l$ and $B^-\to D_0^{*0}(2400)l \bar{\nu}_l$. The branching fraction of the semi-leptonic $\bar B_s^0\to D_s^{*+}(2317)l \bar{\nu}_l$ decay is around $6\times 10^{-3} $ for light leptons and $0.8\times 10^{-3} $ for tau final state. The predicted branching ration of $B^-\to D_0^{*0}(2400)l \bar{\nu}_l$ is slightly larger than $\bar B_s^0\to D_s^{*+}(2317)l \bar{\nu}_l$, and we hope the future data in LHCb can test these results.
