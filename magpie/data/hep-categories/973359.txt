Measurement of the inelastic proton-proton cross section at $\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV
A measurement is presented of the inelastic proton-proton cross section at a centre-of-mass energy of sqrt(s) = 7 TeV. Using the CMS detector at the LHC, the inelastic cross section is measured through two independent methods based on information from (i) forward calorimetry (for pseudorapidity 3 < abs(eta) < 5), in collisions where at least one proton loses more than 5E-6 of its longitudinal momentum, and (ii) the central tracker (abs(eta) < 2.4), in collisions containing an interaction vertex with more than 1, 2, or 3 tracks with transverse momenta pT > 200 MeV. The measurements cover a large fraction of the inelastic cross section for particle production over about 9 units of pseudorapidity and down to small transverse momenta. The results are compared with those of other experiments, and with models used to describe high-energy hadronic interactions.
