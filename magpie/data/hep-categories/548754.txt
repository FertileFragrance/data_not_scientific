All couplings of minimal six-dimensional supergravity
We describe the complete coupling of $(1,0)$ six-dimensional supergravity to tensor, vector and hypermultiplets. The generalized Green-Schwarz mechanism implies that the resulting theory embodies factorized gauge and supersymmetry anomalies, to be disposed of by fermion loops. Consequently, the low-energy theory is determined by the Wess-Zumino consistency conditions, rather than by the requirement of supersymmetry. As already shown for the case without hypermultiplets, this procedure does not fix a quartic coupling for the gauginos. With respect to these previous results, the inclusion of charged hypermultiplets gives additional terms in the supersymmetry anomaly. We also consider the case in which abelian vectors are present. As in the absence of hypermultiplets, abelian vectors allow additional couplings. Finally, we apply the Pasti-Sorokin-Tonin prescription to this model.
