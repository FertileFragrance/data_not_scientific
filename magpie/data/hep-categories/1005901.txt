Perturbative QCD correlations in multi-parton collisions
We examine the role played in double parton interactions (DPI) by the parton--parton correlations originating from perturbative QCD parton splittings. Also presented are the results of the numerical analysis of the integrated DPI cross sections at Tevatron and LHC energies. To obtain the numerical results the knowledge of the single-parton GPDs gained by the HERA experiments was used to construct the non-perturbative input for generalized double parton distributions. The perturbative two-parton correlations induced by three-parton interactions contribute significantly to resolution of the longstanding puzzle of an excess of multi-jet production events in the back-to-back kinematics observed at the Tevatron.
