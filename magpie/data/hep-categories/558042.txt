Anisotropic black holes in Einstein and brane gravity
We consider exact solutions of Einstein equations defining static black holes parametrized by off-diagonal metrics which by anholonomic mappings can be equivalently transformed into some diagonal metrics with coefficients being very similar to those from the Schwarzschild and/or Reissner-Nordstrom solutions with anisotropic renormalizations of constants. We emphasize that such classes of solutions, for instance, with ellipsoidal symmetry of horizons, can be constructed even in general relativity theory if off-diagonal metrics and anholonomic frames are introduced into considerations. Such solutions do not violate the Israel's uniqueness theorems on static black hole configurations because at long radial distances one holds the usual Schwarzschild limit. We show that anisotropic deformations of the Reissner-Nordstrom metric can be an exact solution on the brane, re-interpreted as a black hole with an effective electromagnetic like charge anisotropically induced and polarized by higher dimension gravitational interactions.
