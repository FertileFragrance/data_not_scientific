Direct probes of flavor-changing neutral currents in e$^{+}$ e$^{−}$-collisions
We propose a novel method to study flavor-changing neutral currents in the e$^{+}$ e$^{−}$ → D$^{∗0}$ and e$^{+}$ e$^{−}$ → B$_{s}^{∗}$ transitions, tuning the energy of e$^{+}$ e$^{−}$- collisions to the mass of the narrow vector resonance D$^{∗0}$ or B$_{s}^{∗}$ . We present a thorough study of both short-distance and long-distance contributions to e$^{+}$ e$^{−}$ → D$^{∗0}$ in the Standard Model and investigate possible contributions of new physics in the charm sector. This process, albeit very rare, has clear advantages with respect to the D$^{0}$ → e$^{+}$ e$^{−}$ decay: the helicity suppression is absent, and a richer set of effective operators can be probed. Implications of the same proposal for B$_{s}^{∗}$ are also discussed.
