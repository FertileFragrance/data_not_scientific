Lowering solar mixing angle in inverted hierarchy without charged lepton corrections
In the present work, the inverted hierarchical neutrino mass model which is characterised by opposite CP parity in the first two mass eigenvalues $(m_1,-m_2,m_3)$, is studied in order to lower the predicted value of solar mixing angle $\tan^2\theta_{12}$, from the tri-bimaximal mixing (TBM), without sacrificing the conditions of maximal atmospheric mixing angle and zero reactor angle. The present attempt is different from the earlier approach where the correction from the charged lepton mass matrix is included in the leptonic mixing matrix to lower the prediction on solar mixing angle. The lowering of the solar mixing angle without charged lepton correction, can be obtained through the variation of the input value of a flavour twister term present in the texture of neutrino mass matrix having a 2-3 symmetry. The present analysis agrees with the latest experimental bounds on neutrino mass parameters and also represents an important result on the survival of the inverted hierarchical neutrino mass models having opposite CP parity in the first two eigenvalues.
