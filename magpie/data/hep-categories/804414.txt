F2(c anti-c) measurements at HERA
The study of charm production at the ep collider HERA is particularly interesting since it provides sensitivity to the gluon density in the proton and it allows different models and schemes of pQCD to be tested. New measurements of the charm contri bution F2canti-c to the proton structure function F2 for deep inelastic scattering in e+- p collisions at HERA are presented. These results have been achieved by the two experiments, ZEUS and H1, using different tecniques: tagging of D mesons (D*,D0,D+-.. ) in the final states or measuring the displacement of the decay products of charm decays, exploiting their long lifetime. The data are compared to next-to-leading order pQCD calculations.
