(B-L) symmetry vs. neutrino seesaw
We compute the effective coupling of the Majoron to W bosons at by evaluating the matrix element of the (B–L) current between the vacuum and a W (+) W (−) state. The (B–L) anomaly vanishes, but the amplitude does not vanish as a result of a UV finite and non-local contribution which is entirely due to the mixing between left-chiral and right-chiral neutrinos. The result shows how anomaly-like couplings may arise in spite of the fact that the (B–L) current remains exactly conserved to all orders in ħ, lending additional support to our previous proposal to identify the Majoron with the axion.
