Field-theoretical approach to particle oscillations in absorbing matter
The $ab$ oscillations in absorbing matter are considered. The standard model based on optical potential does not describe the total $ab$ transition probability as well as the channel corresponding to absorption of the $b$-particle. We calculate directly the off-diagonal matrix element in the framework of field-theoretical approach. Contrary to one-particle model, the final state absorption does not tend to suppress the channels mentioned above or, similarly, calculation with hermitian Hamiltonian leads to increase the corresponding values. The model reproduces all the results on the particle oscillations, however it is oriented to the description of the above-mentioned channels. Also we touch on the problem of infrared singularities. The approach under study is infrared-free.
