Multivariate searches for single top quark production with the D0 detector
We present a search for electroweak production of single top quarks in the s-channel (p-pbar -> t bbar + X) and t-channel (p-pbar -> tq bbar + X) modes. We have analyzed 230 pb^(-1) of data collected with the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron collider at a center-of-mass energy of sqrt(s) = 1.96 TeV. Two separate analysis methods are used: neural networks and a cut-based analysis. No evidence for a single top quark signal is found. We set 95% confidence level upper limits on the production cross sections using Bayesian statistics, based on event counts and binned likelihoods formed from the neural network output. The limits from the neural network (cut-based) analysis are 6.4 pb (10.6 pb) in the s-channel and 5.0 pb (11.3 pb) in the t-channel.
