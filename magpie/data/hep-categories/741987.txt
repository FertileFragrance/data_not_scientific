Explicit CP violation in a MSSM with an extra U(1)-prime
We study that a minimal supersymmetric standard model with an extra $U(1)'$ gauge symmetry may accommodate the explicit CP violation at the one-loop level through radiative corrections. This model is CP conserving at the tree level and cannot realize the spontaneous CP violation for a wide parameter space at the one-loop level. In explicit CP violation scenario, we calculate the Higgs boson masses and the magnitude of the scalar-pseudoscalar mixings in this model at the one-loop level by taking into account the contributions of top quarks, bottom quarks, exotic quarks, and their superpartners. In particular, we investigate how the exotic quarks and squarks would affect the scalar-pseudoscalar mixings. It is observed that the size of the mixing between the heaviest scalar and pseudoscalar Higgs bosons is changed up to 20 % by a complex phase originated from the exotic quark sector of this model.
