Tree-unitarity bounds for THDM Higgs masses revisited
We have reconsidered theoretical upper bounds on the scalar boson masses within the two-Higgs-doublet model (THDM), employing the well-known technical condition of tree-level unitarity. Our treatment provides a modest extension and generalization of some previous results of other authors. We present a rather detailed discussion of the solution of the relevant inequalities and offer some new analytic formulae as well as numerical values for the Higgs mass bounds in question. A comparison is made with the earlier results on the subject that can be found in the literature.
