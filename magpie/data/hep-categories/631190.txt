Axions
I review the physics of axions, paying attention to the role as dark matter. This paper is based on talks given at the workshops ``Thinking, Observing and Mining the Universe'' held in Sorrento (Italy), September 22-27, 2003, and at ``International Workshop on Astroparticle and High Energy Physics'' held in Valencia (Spain) October 14-18, 2003.
