Dark Matter and Gauge Coupling Unification in A Supersymmetry Model with Vector-like Matter
WIMP dark matter and gauge coupling unification are considered in an R- parity violating MSSM with vector-like matter. Dark matter is contained in an additional vector-like SU(2)( )L( ) doublet which possesses a new U(1) gauge symmetry. The Higgs fields are extended to be in a representation of SU(5). The stability of dark matter is a result of gauge symmetries, and the mass of the dark matter particle is between (1.1-1.5) TeV. Dark matter has a very small cross section with nucleis, thus the model is consistent with current dark matter direct detection experiments such as Xenon100. The model also predicts new charged and colored particles to be observed at LHC.
