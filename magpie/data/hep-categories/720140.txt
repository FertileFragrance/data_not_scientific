Stabilization of test particles in induced matter Kaluza-Klein theory
The stability conditions for the motion of classical test particles in an $% n $-dimensional Induced Matter Kaluza-Klein theory is studied. We show that stabilization requires a variance of the strong energy condition for the induced matter to hold and that it is related to the hierarchy problem. Stabilization of test particles in a FRW universe is also discussed.
