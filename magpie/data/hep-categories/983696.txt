Self Sustained Traversable Wormholes Induced by Gravity's Rainbow and Noncommutative Geometry
We compare the effects of Noncommutative Geometry and Gravity's Rainbow on traversable wormholes which are sustained by their own gravitational quantum fluctuations. Fixing the geometry on a well tested model, we find that the final result shows that the wormhole is of the Planckian size. This means that the traversability of the wormhole is in principle, but not in practice.
