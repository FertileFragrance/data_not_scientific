Constructing Gravity Amplitudes from Real Soft and Collinear Factorisation
Soft and collinear factorisations can be used to construct expressions for amplitudes in theories of gravity. We generalise the "half-soft" functions used previously to "soft-lifting" functions and use these to generate tree and one-loop amplitudes. In particular we construct expressions for MHV tree amplitudes and the rational terms in one-loop amplitudes in the specific context of N=4 supergravity. To completely determine the rational terms collinear factorisation must also be used. The rational terms for N=4 have a remarkable diagrammatic interpretation as arising from algebraic link diagrams.
