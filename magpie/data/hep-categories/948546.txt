Chiral color quark symmetry and possible constraints on the G'-boson mass from tevatron and LHC data
A gauge model featuring a chiral color symmetry of quarks was considered, and possible manifestations of this symmetry in proton-antiproton and proton-proton collisions at the Tevatron and LHC energies were studied. The cross section for the production of quark pairs at the Tevatron and the forward-backward asymmetry in this process were calculated and analyzed with allowance for the contributions of the G'-boson predicted by the chiral color symmetry of quarks, the G'-boson massm ( )G(') and the mixing angle ( )G( ) being treated as free parameters of the model. Limits on m ( )G(') versus ( )G( ) were studied on the basis of data from the Tevatron on and , and the region compatible with these data within one standard deviation was found in the m ( )G(')- ( )G( ) plane. The region ofm ( )G(')-mass values that is appropriate for observing the G'-boson at LHC is discussed.
