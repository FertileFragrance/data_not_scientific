SUSY Searches with Leptons in the Final State at CMS
Recent results of the searches for Supersymmetry in final states with one or two leptons at CMS are presented. Many Supersymmetry scenarios, including the Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (CMSSM), predict a substantial amount of events containing leptons, while the largest fraction of Standard Model background events -- which are QCD interactions -- gets strongly reduced by requiring isolated leptons. The analyzed data was taken in 2011 and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of approximately $\mathcal{L} = 1\,\text{fb}^{-1}$. The center-of-mass energy of the pp collisions was $\sqrt{s}=7\,\text{TeV}$.
