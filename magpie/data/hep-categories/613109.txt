On the precision of chiral dispersive calculations of pi pi scattering
We calculate the combination $2a_0^{(0)}-5a_0^{(2)}$ (the Olsson sum rule) and the scattering lengths and effective ranges $a_1$, $a_2^{(I)}$ and $b_1$, $b_2^{(I)}$ dispersively (with the Froissart--Gribov representation) using, at low energy, the phase shifts for $\pi\pi$ scattering obtained by Colangelo, Gasser and Leutwyler (CGL) from the Roy equations and chiral perturbation theory, plus experiment and Regge behaviour at high energy, or directly, using the CGL parameters for $a$s and $b$s. We find mismatch, both among the CGL phases themselves and with the results obtained from the pion form factor. This reaches the level of several (2 to 5) standard deviations, and is essentially independent of the details of the intermediate energy region ($0.82\leq E\leq 1.42$ GeV) and, in some cases, of the high energy behaviour assumed. We discuss possible reasons for this mismatch, in particular in connection with an alternate set of phase shifts.
