Superconductivity in supersymmetric theories
The study of superconductivity has been undertaken through the breaking of supersymmetric gauge theories which automatically incorporate the condensation of monopoles and dyons leading to confining and superconducting phases. Constructing the effec tive Lagrangian near a singularity in moduli space for N=2 supersymmetric theory with SU(2) gauge group, it has been shown that when a mass term is added to this Lagrangian, the N=2 Supersymmetry is reduced to N=1 supersymmetry yielding the dyonic condens ation which leads to confinement and superconductivity as the consequence of generalized Meissner effect. In the Coulomb phase of N=2 SU(3) Yang-Mills theory the gauge symmetry has been broken down to SU(2)OeU(l) and it has been shown that on perturbing i t by suitable tree-level superpotential this supersymmetry theory breaks to N=1 SU(2) Yang-Mills theory described by Higgs field in confining phase incorporating superconductivity.
