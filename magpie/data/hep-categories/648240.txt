Gauge identities and the Dirac conjecture
The gauge symmetries of a general dynamical system can be systematically obtained following either a Hamiltonean or a Lagrangean approach. In the former case, these symmetries are generated, according to Dirac's conjecture, by the first class constraints. In the latter approach such local symmetries are reflected in the existence of so called gauge identities. The connection between the two becomes apparent, if one works with a first order Lagrangean formulation. Our analysis applies to purely first class systems. We show that Dirac's conjecture applies to first class constraints which are generated in a particular iterative way, regardless of the possible existence of bifurcations or multiple zeroes of these constraints. We illustrate these statements in terms of several examples.
