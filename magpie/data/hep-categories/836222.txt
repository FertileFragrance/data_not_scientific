Relic neutralinos and the two dark matter candidate events of the CDMS II experiment
The CDMS Collaboration has presented its results for the final exposure of the CDMS II experiment and reports that two candidate events for dark matter would survive after application of the various discrimination and subtraction procedures inherent in their analysis. We show that a population of relic neutralinos, which was already proved to fit the DAMA/LIBRA data on the annual modulation effect, could naturally explain the two candidate CDMS II events, if these are actually due to a dark matter signal.
