A search for anti-electron-neutrinos from the sun at Super-Kamiokande
Results of a search for anti-electron-neutrinos from the sun are presented based on 1496 live-days of Super-Kamiokande-I data taken from May 31 1996 to July 2001. No significant excess of events have been observed and we set an upper limit for the conversion probability to $\bar{\nu}_{e}$ of the 8B solar neutrino. This conversion limit is 0.8% (90% confidence level) of the standard solar model for total energy 8 MeV - 20 MeV. We also set a flux limit for monochromatic $\bar{\nu}_{e}$ for $E_{\bar{\nu}_{e}}$ = 10 MeV - 17 MeV. We have also measured the 8B solar neutrino flux. The ratio of the measured 8B solar neutrino flux to the standard solar model BPB2001 prediction is 0.465 $\pm$ 0.005(stat.)$^{+0.016}_{-0.015}$(sys.). Global analysis of solar neutrino results, SK zenith angle spectra and KamLAND results have been performed for a two neutrino oscillation hypothesis and for a RSFP+MSW hybrid model. The LMA1 solution is singled out at 99% confidence level for the oscillation hypothesis. An upper limit of $\mu_{\nu}B_{sun}$ is obtained by combining the RSFP+MSW global analysis and $\bar{\nu}_{e}$ flux limit. And it turned out that the subdominant RSFP effect cannot exceed a few % level in the solar neutrino deficits.
