Entropy of (1+1)-dimensional charged black hole to all orders in the Planck length
We study the statistical entropy of a scalar field on the (1+1)-dimensional Maxwell-dilaton background without an artificial cutoff considering corrections to all orders in the Planck length from a generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) on the quantum state density. In contrast to the previous results of the higher dimensional cases having adjustable parameter, we obtain an unadjustable entropy due to the independence of the minimal length while this entropy is proportional to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.
