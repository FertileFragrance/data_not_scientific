The Canonical Structure of the First Order Einstein-Hilbert Action
The Dirac constraint formalism is used to analyze the first order form of the Einstein-Hilbert action in d > 2 dimensions. Unlike previous treatments, this is done without eliminating fields at the outset by solving equations of motion that are independent of time derivatives when they correspond to first class constraints. As anticipated by the way in which the affine connection transforms under a diffeomorphism, not only primary and secondary but also tertiary first class constraints arise. These leave d(d - 3) degrees of freedom in phase space. The gauge invariance of the action is discussed, with special attention being paid to the gauge generators of Henneaux, Teitelboim and Zanelli and of Castellani.
