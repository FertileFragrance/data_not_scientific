Dalitz analysis of B ---> K pi+ psi-prime decays and the Z(4430)+
From a Dalitz plot analysis of B --> K pi psi' decays, we find a signal for Z(4430)+ --> pi+ psi' with a mass M= (4443(+15-12)(+19-13))MeV/c^2, width Gamma= (107(+86-43)(+74-56))MeV, product branching fraction BR(B0 --> K- Z(4430)+) x BR(Z(4430)+ --> pi+ psi')= (3.2(+1.8-0.9)(+5.3-1.6)) x 10^{-5}, and significance of 6.4sigma that agrees with previous Belle measurements based on the same data sample. In addition, we determine the branching fraction BR(B^0 --> K*(892)^0 psi')= (5.52(+0.35-0.32)(+0.53-0.58)) x 10^{-4} and the fraction of K*(892)^0 mesons that are longitudinally polarized f_L= 44.8(+4.0-2.7)(+4.0-5.3)%. These results are obtained from a 605fb^{-1} data sample that contains 657 million B-anti-B pairs collected near the Upsilon(4S) resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric energy e+e- collider.
