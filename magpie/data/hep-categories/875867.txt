Tunneling of massive particles from noncommutative inspired Schwarzschild black hole
We apply the generalization of the Parikh-Wilczek method to the tunneling of massive particles from noncommutative inspired Schwarzschild black holes. By deriving the equation of radial motion of the tunneling particle directly, we calculate the emission rate which is shown to be dependent on the noncommutative parameter besides the energy and mass of the tunneling particle. After equating the emission rate to the Boltzmann factor, we obtain the modified Hawking temperature which relates to the noncommutativity and recovers the standard Hawking temperature in the commutative limit. We also discuss the entropy of the noncommutative inspired Schwarzschild black hole and its difference after and before a massive particle's emission.
