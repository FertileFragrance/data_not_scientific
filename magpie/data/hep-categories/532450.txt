The Flavor of neutrinos in muon decays at a neutrino factory and the LSND puzzle
The accurate prediction of the neutrino beam produced in muon decays and the absence of opposite helicity contamination for a particular neutrino flavor make a future neutrino factory the ideal place to look for the lepton flavor violating (LFV) decays of the kind $\mu^+\ra e^+\nuebar\numu$ and lepton number violating (LNV) processes like $\mu^-\ra e^-\nue\numu$. Excellent sensitivities can be achieved using a detector capable of muon and/or electron identification with charge discrimination. This would allow to set experimental limits that improve current ones by more than two orders of magnitude and test the hypothesis that the LSND excess is due to such anomalous decays, rather than neutrino flavor oscillations in vacuum.
