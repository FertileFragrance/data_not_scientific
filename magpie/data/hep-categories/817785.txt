On fermionic reductions of the AdS(4) x CP**3 superstring
We discuss fermionic reductions of type IIA superstrings on AdS4 x CP3 in relation to the conjectured AdS4/CFT3 duality. The superstring theory is described by means of a coset model construction, which is classically integrable. We discuss the global light-cone symmetries of the action and related kappa-symmetry gauge choices, and also present the complete quartic action in covariant form with respect to these. Further, we study integrable (fermionic) reductions, in particular, a reduction yielding a quadratic action of two complex fermions on the string world-sheet. Interestingly, this model appears to be exactly the same as the corresponding integrable reduction found in the AdS5 x S5 case.
