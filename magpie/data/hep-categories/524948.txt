Scattering in three dimensional extremal black holes
An approach to scattering theory in three dimensional AdS spaces is proposed. Firstly we consider the scattering of spinless relativistic particles by a three dimensional extremal black hole and compute the absorption cross section $\sigma_{abs} =J_{abs}/J_{\infty}$ without using {\it in} and {\it out} states. Secondly, we posit a reciprocal space ${\cal H}$ where {\it in} and {\it out} states and the scattering amplitude is defined as in usual scattering theory. We show that both descriptions are equivalent and ${\cal H}$ could be considered as the space where the scattering processes in AdS should be defined.
