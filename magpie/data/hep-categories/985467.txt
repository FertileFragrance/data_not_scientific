From gamma ray line signals of dark matter to the LHC
We explore the relationship between astrophysical gamma-ray signals and LHC signatures for a class of phenomenologically successful secluded dark matter models, motivated by recent evidence for a ~130@?GeV gamma-ray line. We consider in detail scenarios in which interactions between the dark sector and the standard model are mediated by a vev-less scalar field @f, transforming as an N-plet (N >@?3) under SU(2)_L. Since some of the component fields of @f carry large electric charges, loop induced dark matter annihilation to @c@c and @cZ can be enhanced without the need for non-perturbatively large couplings, and without overproduction of continuum gamma-rays from other final states. We discuss prospects for other experimental tests, including dark matter-nucleon scattering and production of @f at the LHC, where future searches for anomalous charged tracks may be sensitive. The first LHC hints could come from the Higgs sector, where loop corrections involving @f lead to significantly modified h ->@?@c@c and h@?->@?@cZ branching ratios.
