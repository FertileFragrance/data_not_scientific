Modified gravity and Space-Time-Matter theory
The correspondence between $f(R)$ theories of gravity and model theories explaining induced dark energy in a 5D Ricci-flat universe, known as the Space-Time-Matter theory (STM), is studied. It is shown that such correspondence may be used to interpret the four dimensional expressions, induced from geometry in 5D STM theories, in terms of the extra terms appearing in $f(R)$ theories of gravity. The method is demonstrated by providing an explicit example in which a given $f(R)$ is used to predict the properties of the corresponding 5D Ricci-flat universe. The accelerated expansion and the induced dark energy in a 5D Ricci-flat universe characterized by a big bounce is studied and it is shown that an arbitrary function $\mu(t)$ in the 5D solutions can be rewritten, in terms of the redshift $z$, as a new arbitrary function $F(z)$ which corresponds to the 4D curvature quintessence models.
