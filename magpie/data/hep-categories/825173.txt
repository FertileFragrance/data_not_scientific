The LHCb analysis for B0(s) ---> mu+ mu-
LHCb, bolstered up by the 10^12 b-hadrons produced yearly, is an excellent place to study rare B decays. The B_s to mu^+ mu^- decay, generated by flavour-changing neutral current, is strongly suppressed within the Standard Model (SM). However, its branching ratio can be significantly enhanced if New Physics (NP) exists. The current best limit is still an order of magnitude above the SM prediction, thus leaving room for observation of NP effects. In this document, the current LHCb analysis strategy for the B_s to mu^+ mu^- search is presented.
