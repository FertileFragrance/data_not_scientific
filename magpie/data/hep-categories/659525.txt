Structure of the electrospheres of bare strange stars
We consider a thin ($\sim 10^2-10^3$ fm) layer of electrons (the electrosphere) at the quark surface of a bare strange star, taking into account the surface effects at the boundary with the vacuum. The quark surface holds the electron layer by an extremely strong electric field, generated in the electrosphere to prevent the electrons from escaping to infinity by counterbalancing the degeneracy and thermal pressure. Because of the surface tension and depletion of $s$ quarks a very thin (a few fm) charged layer of quarks forms at the surface of the star. The formation of this layer modifies the structure of the electrosphere, by significantly changing the electric field and the density of the electrons, in comparison with the case when the surface effects are ignored. Some consequences of the modification of the electrosphere structure on the properties of strange stars are briefly discussed.
