The theory of complex angular momenta: Gribov lectures on theoretical physics
This 2003 book provides a rigorous introduction to the theory of complex angular momenta, based on the methods of field theory. It comprises an English translation of the series of lectures given by V. N. Gribov in 1969, when the physics of high-energy hadron interactions was being created. Besides their historical significance, these lectures contain material which is highly relevant to research today. The basic physical results and the approaches Gribov developed are now being rediscovered in an alternative context: in the microscopic theory of hadrons provided by quantum chromodynamics. The ideas and calculation techniques presented in this book are useful for analysing high-energy hadron scattering phenomena, deep inelastic lepton-hadron scattering, the physics of heavy ion collisions, kinetic phenomena in phase transitions, and will be instrumental in the analysis of electroweak processes at the next-generation particle accelerators, such as LHC and TESLA.
