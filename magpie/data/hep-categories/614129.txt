Casimir effect in kappa deformed theory
Quantum mechanical fluctuations in an interval give rise to the Casimir effect, which destabilizes the size of the interval. This can be problematic in constructing Kaluza-Klein theories. We consider the possibility that a breakdown of the Poincar\'e symmetry in an extra dimension can solve this instability problem. As a specific example, we consider the space-time with a $\kappa$-deformed Poincar\'e algebra, calculate the Casimir force between two plates, and find that we can have an interval with a stable size.
