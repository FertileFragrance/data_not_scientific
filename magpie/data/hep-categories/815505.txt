Dual Quantum Mechanics
We point out a possible complementation of the basic equations of quantum mechanics in the presence of gravity. This complementation is suggested by the well-known fact that quantum mechanics can be equivalently formulated in the position or in the momentum representation. As a way to support this complementation, starting from the action that describes conformal gravity in the world-line formalism, we show that there are duality transformations that relate the dynamics in the presence of position dependent vector and tensor fields to the dynamics in the presence of momentum dependent vector and tensor fields.
