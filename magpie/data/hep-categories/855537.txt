Stability of de Sitter solutions sourced by dark spinors
Cosmology of ELKO and Lorentz Invariant NSS has been investigated using dynamical system method starting from the proposal of Boehmer et al [arXiv:1003.3858]. Some different results have been obtained by a different approach. The exact solutions described by fixed points of the dynamical system and their stability have been discussed. Some stable solutions corresponding to de Sitter universes have been obtained.
