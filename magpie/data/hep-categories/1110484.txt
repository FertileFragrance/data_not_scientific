Associated Production of Higgs Boson and $t\bar t$ at LHC
One of the future goals of the LHC is to precisely measure the properties of Higgs boson. The associated production of Higgs boson and the top quark pair is a promising process to investigate the related Yukawa interaction and the properties of Higgs. Compared with the pure scalar sector in the Standard Model, the Higgs sector contains both scalar and pseudoscalar in many new physics models, which makes the $t\bar t H$ interaction more complex and provides a variety of phenomena. To investigate the $t\bar t H$ interaction and the properties of Higgs, we study the top quark spin correlation observables at the LHC.
