The Geometry of D-Brane Superpotentials
The disk partition function of the open topological string computes the spacetime superpotential for D-branes wrapping cycles of a compact Calabi-Yau threefold. We use string duality to show that when appropriately formulated, the problem admits a natural geometrization in terms of a non-compact Calabi-Yau fourfold without D-branes. The duality relates the D-brane superpotential to a flux superpotential on the fourfold. This sheds light on several features of superpotential computations appearing in the literature, in particular on the observation that Calabi-Yau fourfold geometry enters the problem. In one of our examples, we show that the geometry of fourfolds also reproduces the D-brane superpotentials obtained from matrix factorization methods.
