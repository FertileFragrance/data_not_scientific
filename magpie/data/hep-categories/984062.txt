Neutron-star mergers in scalar-tensor theories of gravity
Scalar-tensor theories of gravity are natural phenomenological alternatives to General Relativity, where the gravitational interaction is mediated by a scalar degree of freedom, besides the usual tensor gravitons. In regions of the parameter space of these theories where constraints from both solar system experiments and binary-pulsar observations are satisfied, we show that binaries of neutron stars present marked differences from General Relativity in both the late-inspiral and merger phases. In particular, phenomena related to the spontaneous scalarization of isolated neutron stars take place in the late stages of the evolution of binary systems, with important effects in the ensuing dynamics. We comment on the relevance of our results for the upcoming Advanced LIGO/Virgo detectors.
