Detecting the neutral top pion at future muon colliders
The signals of the neutral top-pion $\pi^{0}_{t}$ at the first muon collider (FMC) are discussed by calculating its contributions to the processes $\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\longrightarrow b\bar{b}$ and $\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\longrightarrow \bar{t}c$. We find that the contributions to the process $\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\longrightarrow b\bar{b}$ are very small and the ratio of signal over square root of the background ($S/\sqrt{B})$ is smaller than 0.2. However, in most of the parameter space, the $\pi^{0}_{t}$ can generate 36 and up to 649 observable $\bar{t}c$ events at the FMC. The signals of the neutral top-pion $\pi^{0}_{t}$ may be detected via the process $\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\longrightarrow \bar{t}c$ at the FMC.
