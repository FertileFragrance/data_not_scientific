Constraints on LVS Compactifications of IIB String Theory
We argue that once all theoretical and phenomenological constraints are imposed on the different versions of the Large Volume Scenario (LVS) compactifications of type IIB string theory, one particular version is favored. This is essentially a sequestered one in which the soft terms are generated by Weyl anomaly and RG running effects. We also show that arguments questioning sequestering in LVS models are not relevant in this case.
