Higher spin holography with Galilean symmetry in general dimensions
We construct Schroedinger-like solutions of the Vasiliev higher spin theory in D>3 dimension. Symmetries of such solutions and the linearised equation of motion for the scalar on such backgrounds are analysed. We further propose Galilean invariant bosonic and fermionic field theories that could be dual to the two parity invariant higher spin theories on the Schroedinger-like background respectively. The discussion is phrased mainly in D=4 dimension, while similar constructions follow straightforwardly in higher dimensions.
