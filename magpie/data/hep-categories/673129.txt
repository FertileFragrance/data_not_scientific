From target to projectile and back again: Selfduality of high energy evolution
We prove that the complete kernel for the high energy evolution in QCD must be selfdual. The relevant duality transformation is formulated in precise mathematical terms and is shown to transform the charge density into the functional derivative with respect to the single-gluon scattering matrix. This transformation interchanges the high and the low density regimes. We demostrate that the original JIMWLK kernel, valid at large density is indeed dual to the low denisity limit of the complete kernel derived recently in hep-ph/0501198.
