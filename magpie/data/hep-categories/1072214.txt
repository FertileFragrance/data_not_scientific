Renormalized Entanglement Entropy for BPS Black Branes
<p>We compute the renormalized entanglement entropy (REE) for BPS black solutions in <inline-formula><mml:math display="inline"><mml:mi mathvariant="script">N</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:math></inline-formula>, four-dimensional gauged supergravity. We find that this quantity decreases monotonically with the size of the entangling region until it reaches a critical point, then increases and approaches the entropy density of the brane. This behavior can be understood as a consequence of the renormalized entanglement entropy being driven by two competing factors, namely, entanglement and the mixedness of the black brane. In the UV, entanglement dominates, whereas in the IR, the mixedness takes over.</p>
