Negative energy condition and black holes on the brane
We propose that for non-localizable energy distribution the relevant energy condition is determined by the gravitational field energy which is negative for positive non-gravitational energy. That is negativity of the non-localized energy is the "positive" energy condition. This would have direct application and relevance for a black hole on the brane which would be sitting in a trace free stresses induced by the Weyl curvature of the bulk.
