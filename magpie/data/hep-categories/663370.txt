Effects of SO(10)-inspired scalar non-universality on the MSSM parameter space at large tan beta
We analyze the parameter space of the (mu > 0, A_0 = 0) CMSSM at large tan beta with a small degree of non-universality originating from D-terms and Higgs-sfermion splitting inspired by SO(10) GUT models. The effects of such non-universalities on the sparticle spectrum and observables such as (g-2)_mu, B(b -> X_s gamma), the SUSY threshold corrections to the bottom mass and Omega_CDM h^2 are examined in detail and the consequences for the allowed parameter space of the model are investigated. We find that even small deviations to universality can result in large qualitative differences compared to the universal case: for certain values of the parameters, we find, even at low m_16, that radiative electroweak symmetry breaking fails as a consequence of either |mu|^2 < 0 or m_(A^0)^2 < 0. We find particularly large departures from the mSugra case for the neutralino relic density, which is sensitive to significant changes in the position and shape of the A^0 resonance and a substantial increase in the Higgsino component of the LSP. However, we find that the corrections to the bottom mass are not sufficient to allow for Yukawa unification.
