Minimal Supersymmetric Left-Right Model
We revisit the minimal supersymmetric left--right model with B-L=2 triplet Higgs fields and show that a self--consistent picture emerges with automatic R-parity conservation even in the absence of higher dimensional operators. By computing the effective potential for the Higgs system including heavy Majorana neutrino Yukawa couplings we show that the global minimum of the model can lie in the charge and R-parity conserving domain. The model provides natural solutions to the SUSY phase problem and the strong CP problem and makes several interesting predictions. Quark mixing angles arise only after radiative corrections from the lepton sector are taken into account. A pair of doubly charged Higgs fields remain light below TeV with one field acquiring its mass entirely via renormalization group corrections. We find this mass to be not much above the Bino mass. In the supergravity framework for SUSY breaking, we also find similar upper limits on the stau masses. Natural solutions to the $\mu$ problem and the SUSY CP problem entails light SU(2)_L triplet Higgs fields, leading to rich collider phenomenology.
