SuGra on $G_2$ Structure Backgrounds that Asymptote to $AdS_4$ and Holographic Duals of Confining $2+1d$ Gauge Theories with $N=1$ SUSY
In this work the solution generated by performing a U-duality on a deformation of the Maldacena-Nastase solution is studied. This is a solution of type-IIA with a metric that is asymptotically AdS4 and supports a G2 structure. It is believed to be dual to a 2+1d, N=1 gauge theory similar to the baryonic branch of Klebanov-Strassler with an additional intermediate scale. An improved radial coordinate is used allowing the derivation of UV series solutions to the BPS equation that persist to all orders. A study of the properties of the dual field theory is performed which includes an operator analysis, Wilson loops and a proposal for gauge couplings. The gauge theory dual appears to be a confining Chern-Simons quiver with gauge couplings that become constant at high energies.
