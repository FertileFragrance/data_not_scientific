Constraints from Solar and Reactor Neutrinos on Unparticle Long-Range Forces
We have investigated the impact of long-range forces induced by unparticle operators of scalar, vector and tensor nature coupled to fermions in the interpretation of solar neutrinos and KamLAND data. If the unparticle couplings to the neutrinos are mildly non-universal, such long-range forces will not factorize out in the neutrino flavour evolution. As a consequence large deviations from the observed standard matter-induced oscillation pattern for solar neutrinos would be generated. In this case,severe limits can be set on the infrared fix point scale, $\Lambda_u$, and the new physics scale, $M$, as a function of the ultraviolet ($d_{\rm UV}$) and anomalous ($d$) dimension of the unparticle operator. For a scalar unparticle, for instance, assuming the non-universality of the lepton couplings to unparticles to be of the order of a few per mil we find that, for $d_{\rm UV}=3$ and $d=1.1$, $M$ is constrained to be $M> 10^{9}$ TeV ($M> 10^{10}$ TeV) if $\Lambda_u =$ 1 TeV (10 TeV). For given values of $\Lambda_u$ and $d$, the corresponding bounds on $M$ are $\sim 200$ ($\sim 8/\sqrt{\Lambda_u}$) times more stringent for vector (tensor) unparticles as compared to the scalar case. Conversely, these results can be translated into severe constraints on universality violation of the fermion couplings to unparticle operators with scales which can be accessible at future colliders.
