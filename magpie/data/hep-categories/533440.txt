A Model of elementary particle interactions
There is a second kind of light which does not interact with our electrons. However it interacts with some of our protons (p) and some of our neutrons (n) which are both of two kinds: protons (p, p`), neutrons (n`, n) differing in the two kinds of charges (Q1, Q2) associated with the two kinds of light. p [p`] and n` [n] have (Q1, Q2) values equal to (1, 1) [(1, 0)] and (0, 0) [(0, 1)] respectively. There is also a second kind of electron (Q2 =1, Q1= 0), equal in mass to our electron (Q1 = -1, Q2= 0), which does not interact with our (the first) kind of light. Three major scenarios S1, S2 and X4 arise. In S1, matter in the solar system on large scales is predominantly neutralized in both kinds of charges and the weak forces of attraction among the sun and planets are due to a fundamental force of nature. However in this scenario we must postulate that human consciousness is locked on to chemical reactions in the retina involving the first kind of light and the first kind of electrons only. It is oblivious to the simultaneous parallel chemical reactions governed by a chemistry which is based on the second kind of light and the second kind of anti-electrons and involves the same physical atoms manifesting different atomic numbers Z` (= Q2). In scenario S2, matter in the solar system on large scales is predominantly neutralized in the first kind of charge only. In this scenario human consciousness is not restricted in its awareness to a narrowly >....... continued
