Neutrino mass generation in the SO(4) model
Generation of neutrino mass in SO(4) model is proposed here. The algebraic structure of SO(4) is same as to that of $SU(2)_{L}\times SU(2)_{R}$. It is shown that the spontaneous symmetry breaking results three massive as well as three massless gauge bosons. The standard model theory according to which there exist three massive gauge bosons and a massless one is emerged from this model. In the framework of $SU(2)_{L}\times SU(2)_{R}$ a small Dirac neutrino mass is derived. It is also shown that such mass term may vanish with a special choice. The Majorana mass term is not considered here and thus in this model the neutrino mass does not follow seesaw structure.
