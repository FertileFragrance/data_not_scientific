Exact Results for 't Hooft Loops in Gauge Theories on S^4
The path integral of a general N=2 supersymmetric gauge theory on S^4 is exactly evaluated in the presence of a supersymmetric 't Hooft loop operator. The result we find - obtained using localization techniques - captures all perturbative quantum corrections as well as non-perturbative effects due to instantons and monopoles, which are supported at the north pole, south pole and equator of S^4. As a by-product, our gauge theory calculations successfully confirm the predictions made for 't Hooft loops obtained from the calculation of topological defect correlators in Liouville/Toda conformal field theory.
