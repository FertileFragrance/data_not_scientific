A Singlet-Extension of the MSSM for 125 GeV Higgs with the Least Tuning
In order to raise the Higgs mass up to 125 GeV and relieve the fine-tuning associated with the heavy s-top mass in the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM), we propose a new singlet extension of the MSSM. In this scenario, the additional Higgs mass is radiatively generated also in a hidden sector, and the effect is tansmitted to the Higgs through a messenger field. The Higgs mass can be efficiently increased by the parameters of the superpotential as in the extra matter scenario, but free from the constraints on extra colored matter fields by the LHC experiments. As a result, the tuning problem can be remarkably mitigated by taking low enough messenger mass (\sim 300 GeV) and mass parameter scales (\sim 500 GeV).
