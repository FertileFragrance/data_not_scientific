On the effects of the Neumann boundary conditions in the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism
We investigate the effects of the homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions in the scalar electrodynamics with self-interaction. We show that if the length of the finite region is small enough ($a = e{2}M{-1}_{\phi}$, where Mphi is the mass of the sc alar field generated by the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism) the spontaneous symmetry breaking will not be induced and the vector field will not develop mass, however the scalar field will.
