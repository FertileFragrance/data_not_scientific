Non-perturbative contributions in the plane-wave/BMN limit
This talk surveys recent work on the contribution of instantons to the anomalous dimensions of BMN operators in $\calN=4$ supersymmetric Yang--Mills theory and the corresponding non-perturbative contributions to the mass-matrix of excited string states in maximally supersymmetric plane-wave string theory. The dependence on the coupling constants and the impurity mode numbers in the gauge theory and string theory are in striking agreement.
