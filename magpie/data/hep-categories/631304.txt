M(eta(b)) and alpha(s) from nonrelativistic renormalization group
We sum up the next-to-leading logarithmic corrections to the heavy-quarkonium hyperfine splitting using the nonrelativistic renormalization group. On the basis of this result, we predict the mass of the $\eta_b$ meson to be $M(\eta_b)=9419 \pm 11 {(\rm th)} {}^{+9}_{-8} (\delta\alpha_s) MeV$. The experimental measurement of $M(\eta_b)$ with a few MeV error would be sufficient to determine $\alpha_s(M_Z)$ with an accuracy of $\pm 0.003$. The use of the nonrelativistic renormalization group is mandatory to reproduce the experimental value of the hyperfine splitting in charmonium.
