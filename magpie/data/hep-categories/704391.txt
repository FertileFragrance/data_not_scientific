Adiabatic expansion for metric perturbation and the condition to solve the gauge problem for gravitational radiation reaction problem
We examine the adiabatic approximation in the study of a relativistic two-body problem with the gravitational radiation reaction. We recently pointed out that the usual metric perturbation scheme using a perturbation of the stress-energy tensor may not be appropriate for study of the dissipative dynamics of the bodies due to the radiation reaction. We recently proposed a possible approach to solve this problem with a linear black hole perturbation. This paper proposes a non-linear generalization of that method for a general application of this problem. We show that, under a specific gauge condition, the method actually allows us to avoid the gauge problem.
