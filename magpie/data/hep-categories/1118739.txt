Chaotization inside Quantum Black Holes
We show how the horizon geometry and entropy of a Semiclassical Black Hole can be reconstructed from a system of $N>>1$ horizonless conic singularities with average opening angle at the horizon $\langle \Theta \rangle=2\pi$. This conclusion is strongly motivated by a generalized Wheeler-De Witt equation for quantum black holes. We will argument how infalling information will be inevitably chaotized in these systems. A part of the initial probability density will be trapped inside the system, in back and forth scatterings among conic singularities, for a characteristic time close to the Semiclassical BH life-time. Further implications on information paradoxes are discussed.
