Tail-induced spin-orbit effect in the gravitational radiation of compact binaries
Gravitational waves contain tail effects which are due to the back-scattering of linear waves in the curved space-time geometry around the source. In this paper we improve the knowledge and accuracy of the two-body inspiraling post-Newtonian (PN) dynamics and gravitational-wave signal by computing the spin-orbit terms induced by tail effects. Notably, we derive those terms at 3PN order in the gravitational-wave energy flux, and 2.5PN and 3PN orders in the wave polarizations. This is then used to derive the spin-orbit tail effects in the phasing through 3PN order. Our results can be employed to carry out more accurate comparisons with numerical-relativity simulations and to improve the accuracy of analytical templates aimed at describing the whole process of inspiral, merger and ringdown.
