Renormalization group equations and infrared quasifixed point behaviors of nonuniversal soft terms in MSSM
The renormalization group equations(RGEs) of non-universal soft supersymmetric breaking terms with CP violating phases are analyzed in this paper. We obtain the analytic solutions of RGEs by directly solving the RGEs themselves. Compared with the method of spurion expansion our approach proves to be simple and succinct, and easy to extend to the case of complex parameters. With the analytical forms of the solutions we obtained the infrared quasi fixed point behavior of soft terms are analyzed and it turns out to support the notion in scenarios with CP violating phases.
