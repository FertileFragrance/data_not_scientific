Numerical relativity for D dimensional space-times: head-on collisions of black holes and gravitational wave extraction
Black objects in higher dimensional space-times have a remarkably richer structure than their four dimensional counterparts. They appear in a variety of configurations (e.g. black holes, black branes, black rings, black Saturns), and display complex stability phase diagrams. They might also play a key role in high energy physics: for energies above the fundamental Planck scale, gravity is the dominant interaction which, together with the hoop-conjecture, implies that the trans-Planckian scattering of point particles should be well described by black hole scattering. Higher dimensional scenarios with a fundamental Planck scale of the order of TeV predict, therefore, black hole production at the LHC, as well as in future colliders with yet higher energies. In this setting, accurate predictions for the production cross-section and energy loss (through gravitational radiation) in the formation of black holes in parton-parton collisions is crucial for accurate phenomenological modelling in Monte Carlo event generators. In this paper, we use the formalism and numerical code reported in arXiv:1001.2302 to study the head-on collision of two black holes. For this purpose we provide a detailed treatment of gravitational wave extraction in generic D-dimensional space-times, which uses the Kodama-Ishibashi formalism. For the first time, we present the results of numerical simulations of the head-on collision in five space-time dimensions, together with the relevant physical quantities. We show that the total radiated energy, when two black holes collide from rest at infinity, is approximately (0.089\pm 0.006)% of the centre of mass energy, slightly larger than the 0.055% obtained in the four dimensional case, and that the ringdown signal at late time is in very good agreement with perturbative calculations.
