Forward-backward asymmetries in Lambda(b) ---> Lambda l+ l- decay beyond the standard model
We study the doubly-polarized lepton pair forward-backward asymmetries in (Lambda_b -> Lambda l^+ l^-) decay using a general, model independent form of the effective Hamiltonian. We present the general expression for nine double-polarization forward-backward asymmetries. It is observed that, the study of the forward-backward asymmetries of the doubly-polarized lepton pair is a very useful tool for establishing new physics beyond the standard model. Moreover, the correlation between forward-backward asymmetry and branching ratio is investigated. It is shown that there exist certain certain regions of the new Wilson coefficients where new physics can be established by measuring the polarized forward-backward asymmetry only.
