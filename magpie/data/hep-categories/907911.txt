Charged Quantum Black Holes: Thermal Stability Criterion
A criterion of thermal stability is derived for electrically charged quantum} black holes having large horizon area (compared to Planck area), as an inequality between the mass of the black hole and its microcanonical entropy. The derivation is based on key results of Loop Quantum Gravity and equilibrium statistical mechanics of a grand canonical ensemble, with Gaussian fluctuations around an equilibrium thermal configuration assumed here to be a quantum isolated horizon. No aspect of classical black hole geometry is used to deduce the stability criterion. Since, no particular form of the mass function is used a priori, our stability criterion provides a platform to test the thermal stability of a black hole with a given mass function. The mass functions of the two most familiar charged black hole solutions are tested as a fiducial check. We also discuss the validity of the saddle point approximation used to incorporate thermal fluctuations. Moreover, the equilibrium Hawking temperature is shown to have an additional quantum correction over the semiclassical value.
