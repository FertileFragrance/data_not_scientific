Cryptobaryonic dark matter
It is proposed that dark matter could consist of compressed collections of atoms (or metallic matter) encapsulated into, for example, 20 cm big pieces of a different phase. The idea is based on the assumption that there exists at least one other phase of the vacuum degenerate with the usual one. Apart from the degeneracy of the phases we only assume Standard Model physics. The other phase has a Higgs VEV appreciably smaller than in the usual electroweak vacuum. The balls making up the dark matter are very difficult to observe directly, but inside dense stars may expand eating up the star and cause huge explosions (gamma ray bursts). The ratio of dark matter to ordinary baryonic matter is expressed as a ratio of nuclear binding energies and predicted to be about 5.
