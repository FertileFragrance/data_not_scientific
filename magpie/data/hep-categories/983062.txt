Dark matter particles in the galactic halo: DAMA/LIBRA results and perspectives
Most of the Universe is Dark and a large fraction of it should be made of relic particles, many possibilities are open on their nature and interaction types. Thus, their investigation is an outstanding issue in the field, for this purpose experiments offering a model independent signature for the presence of Dark Matter (DM) particles in the Galactic halo are mandatory. In this paper the DAMA/LIBRA results are described. In particular, the DAMA/LIBRA experiment is mainly devoted to the investigation of DM particles in the Galactic halo by exploiting the model independent DM annual modulation signature. The present DAMA/LIBRA and the former DAMA/NaI (exposed masses: = 250 kg and = 100 kg of highly radiopure NaI(Tl), respectively) experiments have released so far a total exposure of 1.17 ton x yr collected over 13 annual cycles, they provide a model independent evidence of the presence of DM particles in the galactic halo at 8.9 sigma C.L.. Future perspectives are mentioned.
