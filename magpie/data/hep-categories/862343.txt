Discovering SUSY in the First LHC Run
We analyze the potential of the first LHC physics run, assuming 1/fb at sqrt[s] = 7 TeV, to discover Supersymmetry (SUSY). The results are based on SUSY parameter fits following a frequentist approach. They include the experimental constraints from electroweak precision data, (g-2)_mu, B-physics and cosmological data. The two SUSY models under consideration are the constrained MSSM (CMSSM) with universal soft supersymmetry-breaking mass parameters, and a model with common non-universal Higgs mass parameters in the superpotential (NUHM1). We find that large parts of the regions preferred at the 68% C.L. are accessible to early LHC running.
