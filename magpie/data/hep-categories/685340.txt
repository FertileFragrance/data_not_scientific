Production and FCNC decay of supersymmetric Higgs bosons into heavy quarks in the LHC
We analyze the production and subsequent decay of the neutral MSSM Higgs bosons (h = h^0, H^0, A^0) mediated by flavor changing neutral currents (FCNC) in the LHC collider. We have computed the h-production cross-section times the FCNC branching ratio, \sigma(pp -> h -> qq') = \sigma(pp -> h) B(h -> qq'), in the LHC focusing on the strongly-interacting FCNC sector. Here qq' is an electrically neutral pair of quarks of different flavors, the dominant modes being those containing a heavy quark: tc or bs. We determine the maximum production rates for each of these modes and identify the relevant regions of the MSSM parameter space, after taking into account the severe restrictions imposed by low energy FCNC processes. The analysis of \sigma(pp -> h -> qq') singles out regions of the MSSM parameter space different from those obtained by maximizing only the branching ratio, due to non-trivial correlations between the parameters that maximize/minimize each isolated factor. The production rates for the bs channel can be huge for a FCNC process (0.1-1 pb), but its detection can be problematic. The production rates for the tc channel are more modest (10^{-3}-10^{-2} pb), but its detection should be easier due to the clear-cut top quark signature. A few thousand tc events could be collected in the highest luminosity phase of the LHC, with no counterpart in the SM.
