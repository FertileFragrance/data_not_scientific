The Graviton one-loop effective action in cosmological space-times with constant deceleration
We consider the quantum Friedmann equations which include one-loop vacuum fluctuations due to gravitons and scalar field matter in a FLRW background with constant epsilon=-(dH/dt)/H^2. The resulting expression shows a secular growth if epsilon=n/(1+n) or epsilon=(n+1)/n, with n positive integer and epsilon != {0,1}. We argue that the growing terms are physical and cannot be subtracted by local counterterms. Depending on the initial conditions, the secular growth significantly changes the late time behavior of the Universe. We study a simple model with a cosmological constant plus (relativistic) matter and find that the Universe never enters a dark energy dominated regime, but instead asymptotes towards a phase that effectively looks like a matter dominated universe. Due to the secular growth, an arbitrary large initial cosmological constant is at late times screened by the quantum corrections. We extensively discuss the validity of our assumptions and approximations.
