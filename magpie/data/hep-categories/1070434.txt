Stability constraints of the scalar potential in extensions of the Standard Model with TeV scale right handed neutrinos
We investigate the stability of the scalar potential in a minimal $U(1)'$ extension of the Standard Model augmented by an extra complex scalar and three right handed neutrinos. We consider a type-I seesaw scenario for the generation of the small neutrino masses. Moreover, we focus our analysis on a class of models potentially accessible at the LHC experiment, in which the vacuum expectation value of the extra scalar is chosen in the TeV range. We show that the requirements of stability of the potential within the perturbative evolution under the renormalization group impose significant constraints on the Yukawa couplings of the right handed neutrinos.
