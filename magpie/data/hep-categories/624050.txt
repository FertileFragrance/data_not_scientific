Lorentz invariant nonAbelian gauge theory on noncommutative space-time and BRST symmetry
Lorentz covariance is the fundamental principle of every relativistic field theory which insures consistent physical descriptions. Even if the space-time is noncommutative, field theories on it should keep Lorentz covariance. In this paper, the nonabelian gauge theory on noncommutative spacetime is defined and its Lorentz invariance is maintained based on the idea of Carlson, Carone and Zobin. The deviation from the standard model in particle physics has not yet observed, and so any model beyond standard model must reduce to it in some approximation. Noncommutative gauge theory must also reproduce standard model in the limit of noncommutative parameter $\theta^{\mu\nu}\to0$. Referring to Jur$\check{\text{c}}$o {\it et. al.}, we will construct the nonabelian gauge theory that deserves to formulate standard model. BRST symmetry is very important to quantize nonabelian gauge theory and construct the covariant canonical formulation. It is discussed about the fields in noncommutative gauge theory without considering those components. Scale symmetry of ghost fields is also discussed.
