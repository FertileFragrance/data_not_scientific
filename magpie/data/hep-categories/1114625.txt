Scattering Equations and Global Duality of Residues
We examine the polynomial form of the scattering equations by means of computational algebraic geometry. The scattering equations are the backbone of the Cachazo-He-Yuan (CHY) representation of the S-matrix. We explain how the Bezoutian matrix facilitates the calculation of amplitudes in the CHY formalism, without explicitly solving the scattering equations or summing over the individual residues. Since for $n$-particle scattering, the size of Bezoutian matrix grows only as $(n-3)\times(n-3)$, our algorithm is very efficient for analytic and numeric amplitude computations.
