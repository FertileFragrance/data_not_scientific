Bianchi type I string dust magnetized cosmological models in Lyra geometry
Bianchi type I string dust cosmological models in the presence and absence of magnetic field in the frame work of Lyra geometry are investigated. To get the deterministic model of the universe, we assume that the eigenvalue (I (1)(1)) of shear ten sor (I (j)(i)) is proportional to expansion ( ). This leads to A = (BC)(n), where A, B, C are metric potentials and n is a constant. To discuss the results in terms of cosmic time t, we have considered n = 1. The physical and geometrical aspects of the m odels and singularities in the models are also discussed.
