U(N) gauged N=2 supergravity and partial breaking of local N=2 supersymmetry
We study a minimal model of U(N) gauged N=2 supergravity with one hypermultiplet parametrizing SO(4,1)/SO(4) quaternionic manifold. Local N=2 supersymmetry is known to be spontaneously broken to N=1 in the Higgs phase of U(1)_{graviphoton} \times U(1). Several properties are obtained of this model in the vacuum of unbroken SU(N) gauge group. In particular, we derive mass spectrum analogous to the rigid counterpart and put the entire effective potential on this vacuum in the standard superpotential form of N=1 supergravity.
