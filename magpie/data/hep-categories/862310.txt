New approach for jet-shape identification of TeV-scale particles at the LHC
A new approach to jet-shape identification based on linear regression is discussed. It is designed for searches for new particles at the TeV scale decaying hadronically with strongly collimated jets. We illustrate the method using a Monte Carlo simulation for pp collisions at the LHC with the goal to reduce the contribution of QCD-induced events. We focus on a rather generic example X to ttbar to hadrons, with X being a heavy particle, but the approach is well suited for reconstruction of other decay channels characterized by a cascade decay of known states.
