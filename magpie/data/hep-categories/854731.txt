Pair Production of fourth family charged sleptons at $e^{+}e^{-}$ colliders
We study the pair production of $Â¥tilde{l}_{4}$, which is the supersymmetric partner of the fourth family charged lepton, at the $e^{+}e^{-}$ colliders. It is shown that the investigation of this process at ILC/CLIC will give opportunity to differentiate the MSSM with three and four families.
