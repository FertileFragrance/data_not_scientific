Search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in the $H$ to $\tau^{+} \tau^{-}$ decay mode in $\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV $pp$ collisions with ATLAS
A search for the Standard Model Higgs boson decaying into a pair of tau leptons is reported. The analysis is based on a data sample of proton-proton collisions collected by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.7 fb^-1. No significant excess over the expected background is observed in the Higgs boson mass range of 100-150 GeV. The observed (expected) upper limits on the cross section times the branching ratio for H to tau+ tau- are found to be between 2.9 (3.4) and 11.7 (8.2) times the Standard Model prediction for this mass range.
