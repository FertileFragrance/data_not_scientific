Heavy Probes in Strongly Coupled Plasmas with Chemical Potential
We study the properties of heavy probes moving in strongly coupled plasmas at finite chemical potential. Using the gauge/gravity duality we consider large classes of gravity models consisting in deformed AdS5 spacetimes endowed with Reissner-Nordstr\"om-type black holes. We report on our analysis of the screening distance of a quark-antiquark pair, its free energy, and the running coupling. These observables show a certain insensitivity as to which model and deformation is used, pointing to strong-coupling universal behavior. Thus, the results may be relevant for modeling heavy quarkonia traversing a quark-gluon plasma at finite net baryon density, and their suppression by melting.
