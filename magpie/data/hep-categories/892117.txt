Gravitational waves and nonaxisymmetric oscillation modes in mergers of compact object binaries
We study the excitation of nonaxisymmetric modes in the post-merger phase of binary compact object mergers and the associated gravitational wave emission. Our analysis is based on general-relativistic simulations, in the spatial conformal flatness approximation, using smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics for the evolution of matter, and we use a set of equal and unequal mass models, described by two nonzero-temperature hadronic equations of state and by one strange star equation of state. Through Fourier transforms of the evolution of matter variables, we can identify a number of oscillation modes, as well as several nonlinear components (combination frequencies). We focus on the dominant m=2 mode, which forms a triplet with two nonlinear components that are the result of coupling to the quasiradial mode. A corresponding triplet of frequencies is identified in the gravitational wave spectrum, when the individual masses of the compact objects are in the most likely range of 1.2 to 1.35 $M_\odot$. We can thus associate, through direct analysis of the dynamics of the fluid, a specific frequency peak in the gravitational wave spectrum with the nonlinear component resulting from the difference between the m=2 mode and the quasiradial mode. Once such observations become available, both the m=2 and quasiradial mode frequencies could be extracted, allowing for the application of gravitational-wave asteroseismology to the post-merger remnant and leading to tight constraints on the equation of state of high-density matter.
