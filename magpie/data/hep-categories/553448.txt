Late time evolution of a selfinteracting scalar field in the space-time of dilaton black hole
We investigate the late-time tails of self-interacting (massive) scalar fields in the spacetime of dilaton black hole. Following the no hair theorem we examine the mechanism by which self-interacting scalar hair decay. We revealed that the intermediate asymptotic behavior of the considered field perturbations is dominated by an oscillatory inverse power-law decaying tail. The numerical simulations showed that at the very late-time massive self-interacting scalar hair decayed slower than any power law.
