Next-to-leading order QCD corrections to spectator effects in lifetimes of beauty hadrons
Theoretical predictions of beauty hadron lifetimes, based on the heavy quark expansion up to and including order 1/mb^2, do not to reproduce the experimental measurements of the lifetime ratios tau(B+)/tau(Bd) and tau(Lambdab)/tau(Bd). Large corrections to these predictions come from phase-space enhanced 1/mb^3 contributions, i.e. hard spectator effects. In this paper we calculate the next-to-leading order QCD corrections to the Wilson coefficients of the local operators appearing at O(1/mb^3). We find that these corrections improve the agreement with the experimental data. The lifetime ratio of charged to neutral B mesons, tau(B+)/tau(Bd), turns out to be in very good agreement with the corresponding measurement, whereas for tau(Bs)/tau(Bd) and tau(Lambdab)/tau(Bd) there is a residual difference at the 1-sigma level. We discuss, however, why the theoretical predictions are less accurate in the latter cases.
