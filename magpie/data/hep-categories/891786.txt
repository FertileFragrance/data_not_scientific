Three-parton contribution to pion form factor in $k_T$ factorization
We set up a framework for the study of the power-suppressed three-parton contribution to the pion electromagnetic form factor in the $k_T$ factorization theorem. It is first shown that the gauge dependence proportional to parton transverse momenta from the two-parton Fock state and the gauge dependence associated with the three-parton Fock state cancel each other. After verifying the gauge invariance, we derive the three-parton-to-three-parton $k_T$-dependent hard kernel at leading order of the coupling constant, and find that it leads to about 5% correction to the pion electromagnetic form factor in the whole range of experimentally accessible momentum transfer squared. This subleading contribution is much smaller than the leading-order twist-2, next-to-leading-order twist-2 and leading-order two-parton twist-3 ones, which have been calculated in the literature.
