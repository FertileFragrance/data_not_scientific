A Collection of exercises in two-dimensional physics. Part 1
This document is an introduction to and review of two-dimensional mathematical physics. The reader is introduced to the subject matter primarily through problems, which are presented along with detailed worked solutions. For each chapter, there is a brief summary of important results and ideas that precedes the problems and the solutions. This document can be worked through independently by one wishing to learn this subject; alternatively, this could serve as a companion to a more conventional review article or textbook on the subject. The current release contains Part I, and includes six chapters: 1. Curiosities In 2 Dimensions 2. General Principles Of Conformal Field Theory 3. Correlators In Critical Models 4. Other Models In Conformal Field Theory 5. Construction Of New Models 6. Modular Invariance
