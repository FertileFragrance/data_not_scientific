Proving the PP wave / CFT(2) duality
We study the duality between IIB string theory on a pp-wave background, arising as a Penrose limit of the $AdS_3 \times S^3\times M$, where $M$ is $T^4$ (or $K3$), and the 2D CFT which is given by the ${\cal N}=(4,4)$ orbifold $(M)^N/S_N$, resolved by a blowing-up mode. After analizying the action of the supercharges on both sides, we establish a correspondence between the states of the two theories. In particular and for the $T^4$ case, we identify both massive and massless oscillators on the pp-wave, with certain classes of excited states in the resolved CFT carrying large $R$-charge $n$. For the former, the excited states involve fractional modes of the generators of the ${\cal N}=4$ chiral algebra acting on the $Z_n$ ground states. For the latter, they involve, fractional modes of the $U(1)^4_L\times U(1)^4_R$ super-current algebra acting on the $Z_n$ ground states. By using conformal perturbation theory we compute the leading order correction to the conformal dimensions of the first class of states, due to the presence of the blowing up mode. We find agreement, to this order, with the corresponding spectrum of massive oscillators on the pp-wave. We also discuss the issue of higher order corrections.}
