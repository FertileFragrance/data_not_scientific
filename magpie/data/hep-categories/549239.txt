Influence of the particles creation on the flat and negative curved FLRW universes
We present a dynamical analysis of the (classical) spatially flat and negative curved Friedmann-Lameitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universes evolving, (by assumption) close to the thermodynamic equilibrium, in presence of a particles creation process, described by means of a realiable phenomenological approach, based on the application to the comoving volume (i. e. spatial volume of unit comoving coordinates) of the theory for open thermodynamic systems. In particular we show how, since the particles creation phenomenon induces a negative pressure term, then the choice of a well-grounded ansatz for the time variation of the particles number, leads to a deep modification of the very early standard FLRW dynamics. More precisely for the considered FLRW models, we find (in addition to the limiting case of their standard behaviours) solutions corresponding to an early universe characterized respectively by an "eternal" inflationary-like birth and a spatial curvature dominated singularity. In both these cases the so-called horizon problem finds a natural solution.
