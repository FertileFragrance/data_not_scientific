Anomaly breaking of de Sitter symmetry
To one loop order, interacting boson fields on de Sitter space have an 'infrared' anomaly that breaks the de Sitter symmetry for all vacua save the Euclidian one. The divergence of a symmetry current at point $x$ has a non-zero contribution at the antipodal point ${\bar x}$.
