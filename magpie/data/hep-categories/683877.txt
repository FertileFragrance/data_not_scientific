On monopoles and domain walls
The purpose of this paper is to describe a relationship between maximally supersymmetric domain walls and magnetic monopoles. We show that the moduli space of domain walls in non-abelian gauge theories with N flavors is isomorphic to a complex, middle dimensional, submanifold of the moduli space of U(N) magnetic monopoles. This submanifold is defined by the fixed point set of a circle action rotating the monopoles in the plane. To derive this result we present a D-brane construction of domain walls, yielding a description of their dynamics in terms of truncated Nahm equations. The physical explanation for the relationship lies in the fact that domain walls, in the guise of kinks on a vortex string, correspond to magnetic monopoles confined by the Meissner effect.
