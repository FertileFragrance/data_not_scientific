Physics for the future colliders
Physics issues at the upcoming and planned colliders are discussed. We critically review the the different arguments that suggest that New Physics is bound to materialise at the TeV scale and why we should keep an open minded approach. The complementarity of the LHC and a moderate energy e+ e- collider is stressed together with the need for higher energy machines.
