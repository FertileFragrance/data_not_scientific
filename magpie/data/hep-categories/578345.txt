Quark hadron duality in a relativistic, confining model
Quark-hadron duality is an interesting and potentially very useful phenomenon, as it relates the properly averaged hadronic data to a perturbative QCD result in some kinematic regions. While duality is well established experimentally, our current theoretical understanding is still incomplete. We employ a simple model to qualitatively reproduce all the features of Bloom-Gilman duality as seen in electron scattering. In particular, we address the role of relativity, give an explicit analytic proof of the equality of the hadronic and partonic scaling curves, and show how the transition from coherent to incoherent scattering takes place.
