Hybrid compactification with a global cosmic string within the Brans-Dicke theory
We derive a solution of the gravitational equations which leads to a braneworld scenario in six dimensions using a global cosmic string solution in a low energy effective string theory framework. The final spacetime is composed by one warped brane with $\mathbb{R}^{(3,1)}\times S^{1}$ topology and a power law warp factor, and one noncompact extra dimension transverse to the brane. By looking at the current experimental bounds, we find a range of parameters in which, if the on-brane dimension has an acceptable size, it does not solve the hierarchy problem. In another example this problem is smoothed by the Brans-Dicke parameter.
