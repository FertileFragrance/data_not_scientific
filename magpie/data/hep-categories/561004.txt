Possibility of spontaneous CP violation in the nonminimal supersymmetric standard model with two neutral higgs singlets
A supersymmetric standard model with two Higgs doublets and two Higgs singlets is investigated if it can accommodate the possibility of spontaneous CP violation. Assuming the degeneracy of the scalar quark masses of the third generation, we find that spontaneous CP violation in the Higgs sector is viable in our model. In the case of spontaneous CP violation, the masses of the lightest two neutral Higgs bosons are estimated to be 80 and 125 GeV for some parameter values in our model, which, are consistent with LEP2 data.
