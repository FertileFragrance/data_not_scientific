Asymptotic Helicity Conservation in SUSY
We summarize the extensive work started in ref.1, according to which total helicity is conserved for any two-to-two process, at sqrt{s} larger than M_{SUSY} and fixed angles, in any SUSY extension of SM. Asymptotically the theorem is exact. But it may also have important implications at lower energies sqrt{s} close to M_{SUSY}. Up to now, these have been investigated to 1loop electroweak (EW) order for the processes ug to d W+, sd_L chi+; as well as the 17 gg to HH', and the 9 gg to VH processes, where H,H' denote Higgs or Goldstone bosons, and V=Z, W.
