Searches for supersymmetry in final states with leptons or photons and missing energy
We present the results of searches for Supersymmetry in various topologies that lead to final states with jets and missing transverse momentum together with one or more isolated leptons, one or two photons or a photon and a lepton. The searches are performed using data collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC in pp-collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. Various data- driven techniques used to measure the Standard Model backgrounds are discussed. The results are interpreted in the CMSSM framework.
