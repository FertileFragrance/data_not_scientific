Comments on heterotic flux compactifications
In heterotic flux compactification with supersymmetry, three different connections with torsion appear naturally, all in the form $\omega+a H$. Supersymmetry condition carries $a=-1$, the Dirac operator has $a=-1/3$, and higher order term in the effective action involves $a=1$. With a view toward the gauge sector, we explore the geometry with such torsions. After reviewing the supersymmetry constraints and finding a relation between the scalar curvature and the flux, we derive the squared form of the zero mode equations for gauge fermions. With $\d H=0$, the operator has a positive potential term, and the mass of the unbroken gauge sector appears formally positive definite. However, this apparent contradiction is avoided by a no-go theorem that the compactification with $H\neq 0$ and $\d H=0$ is necessarily singular, and the formal positivity is invalid. With $\d H\neq 0$, smooth compactification becomes possible. We show that, at least near smooth supersymmetric solution, the size of $H^2$ should be comparable to that of $\d H$ and the consistent truncation of action has to keep $\alpha'R^2$ term. A warp factor equation of motion is rewritten with $\alpha' R^2$ contribution included precisely, and some limits are considered.
