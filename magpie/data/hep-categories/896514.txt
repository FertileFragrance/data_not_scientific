Pair production of charged top-pions associated with Z gauge boson in the topcolor-assisted technicolor model at the ILC
The top-pions $(\pi{0, \pm}_t)$ are the three additional typical particles predicted by the topcolor-assisted technicolor (TC2) model and the observation of these particles can be regarded as the direct evidence of the TC2 model. In this paper, we investigate the production of a pair of charged top-pions associated with Z gauge boson at the International Linear Collider (ILC), i.e. $e+e-\rightarrow Z\pi{+}_t\pi{-}_t$ and $\gamma\gamma\rightarrow Z\pi{+}_t\pi{-}_t$. We calculate the production rate of the process $e+e-\rightarrow Z\pi{+}_t\pi{-}_t$ and present the distributions of the transverse momenta of Z gauge boson and charged top-pion $\pi{+}_t$. We find that the cross-section of the process $e+e-\rightarrow Z\pi{+}_t\pi{-}_t$ can reach 1 fb w ith reasonable parameter space of the TC2 model. Considering the main decay mode of charged top-pion, we find that such a production may provide copious events. While the cross-section of the process $\gamma\gamma\rightarrow Z\pi{+}_t\pi{-}_t$ is below 1 fb, hence the process $e+e-\rightarrow Z\pi{+}_t\pi{-}_t$ will play an important role in the test of the TC2 model at the ILC when compared with the process $\gamma\gamma\rightarrow Z\pi{+}_t\pi{-}_t$.
