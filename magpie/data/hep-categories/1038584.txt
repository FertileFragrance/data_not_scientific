Measurement of Feynman-$x$ Spectra of Photons and Neutrons in the Very Forward Direction in Deep-Inelastic Scattering at HERA
Measurements of normalised cross sections for the production of photons and neutrons at very small angles with respect to the proton beam direction in deep-inelastic $ep$ scattering at HERA are presented as a function of the Feynman variable $x_F$ and of the centre-of-mass energy of the virtual photon-proton system $W$. The data are taken with the H1 detector in the years 2006 and 2007 and correspond to an integrated luminosity of $131 \mathrm{pb}^{-1}$. The measurement is restricted to photons and neutrons in the pseudorapidity range $\eta>7.9$ and covers the range of negative four momentum transfer squared at the positron vertex $6<Q^2<100$ GeV$^2$, of inelasticity $0.05<y<0.6$ and of $70<W<245 $GeV. To test the Feynman scaling hypothesis the $W$ dependence of the $x_F$ dependent cross sections is investigated. Predictions of deep-inelastic scattering models and of models for hadronic interactions of high energy cosmic rays are compared to the measured cross sections.
