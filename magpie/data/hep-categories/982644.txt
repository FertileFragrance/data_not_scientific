Determining MSSM parameters via chargino production at the LC: a one-loop analysis
Very precise measurements of masses and cross sections are expected to be achievable with a future linear collider. With such an accuracy one must incorporate loop corrections in order to make meaningful predictions for the underlying new physics parameters. For the electroweakino sector, this involves fitting one-loop predictions to expected measurements of the cross section and forward-backward asymmetry for chargino pair production and of the accessible chargino and neutralino masses. We consider two scenarios with characteristic features, chosen taking recent LHC SUSY and Higgs searches into account. Our analysis allows the accurate determination of the desired parameters and, additionally, access to stop sector parameters that enter via loop corrections.
