Can inflation, dark matter and dark energy be described in terms of a single, real scalar field?
In this article, our aim is to consider inflation, dark energy and dark matter in the framework of a real scalar field. To this end, we use the quintessence approach. We have tried a real scalar field with a specific self-interaction potential in a spacially flat universe. Numerical results indicate that this potential can drive the expansion of the universe in three distinct phases. The first phase behaves as an inflationary expansion. For this stage, setting the scalar field’s initial value to ϕ$_{0}$≥1.94 leads to $\mathcal{N}\geq 68$ favored by observation. After the inflationary phase, the scalar field starts an oscillatory behavior which averages to a $\bar{w}=0$ fluid. This stage can be taken as a cold dark matter (p≈0) epoch expected from works on the structure formation issue. Observations and cosmological models indicate that t$_{inf}$ ≈10$^{−35}$ s and the matter dominated lasts for t$_{m}$ ≈10$^{17}$ s, hence $(\frac{t_{m}}{t_{inf}})_{obs}\approx10^{52}$ . We have shown that the present model can satisfy such a constraint. Finally, the scalar field leaves the oscillatory behavior and once again enters a second inflationary stage which can be identified with the recent accelerated expansion of the universe. We have also compared our model with the ΛCDM model and have found a very good agreement between the equation of state parameter of both of models during the DM and DE era.
