Linking generalized parton distributions to constituent quark models
The link between the nucleon generalized parton distributions and the non-diagonal one-body density matrix in momentum space is studied. Attention is focussed on the region where quark generalized parton distributions (GPD's) describe emission and reabsorption of a single active quark by the target nucleon. The correct covariant connection with wave functions used in any constituent quark model is established. Results obtained with different constituent quark models are presented for the unpolarized quark GPD's.
