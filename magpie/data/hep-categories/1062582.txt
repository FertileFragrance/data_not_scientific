$\bar{B}\rightarrow X_s\gamma$ in the $\mu\nu$SSM
The $\mu\nu$SSM, one of supersymmetric extensions beyond the Standard Model, introduces three singlet right-handed neutrino superfields to solve the $\mu$ problem and can generate three tiny Majorana neutrino masses through the seesaw mechanism. In this work, we investigate the rare decay process $\bar{B}\rightarrow X_s\gamma$ in the $\mu\nu$SSM, under a minimal flavor violating assumption for the soft breaking terms. Constrained by the SM-like Higgs with mass around 125 GeV, the numerical results show that the new physics can fit the experimental data for $\bar{B}\rightarrow X_s\gamma$ and further constrain the parameter space.
