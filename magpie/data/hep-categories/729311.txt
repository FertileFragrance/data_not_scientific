Direct test of time reversal invariance violation in B mesons
In this letter we reinterpret and reanalyze the available data of the B meson factories showing the existence of direct experimental evidence of time reversal invariance violation in B mesons. This reinterpretation consists of using the available observables to define a new observable which, in a model independent way and without assuming CPT invariance, compares a transition between a $B^0$ and a here-defined $B_\alpha$-state, with its time reversed transition. The observable then offers a direct way to probe time reversal invariance and it is therefore independent of any conclusion obtained from current experimental information on CP violation and CPT invariance. As far as the authors are concerned, this is the first direct evidence of time reversal invariance violation in B mesons and also the first one obtained from decaying particles whose mean life time difference is negligible.
