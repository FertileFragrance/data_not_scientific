Toric duality, Seiberg duality and Picard-Lefschetz transformations
Toric Duality arises as an ambiguity in computing the quiver gauge theory living on a D3-brane which probes a toric singularity. It is reviewed how, in simple cases Toric Duality is Seiberg Duality. The set of all Seiberg Dualities on a single node in the quiver forms a group which is contained in a larger group given by a set of Picard-Lefschetz transformations. This leads to elements in the group (sometimes called fractional Seiberg Duals) which are not Seiberg Duality on a single node, thus providing a new set of gauge theories which flow to the same universality class in the Infra Red.
