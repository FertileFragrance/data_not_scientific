Natural Inflation: Status after WMAP 3-year data
The model of Natural Inflation is examined in light of recent 3-year data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe and shown to provide a good fit. The inflaton potential is naturally flat due to shift symmetries, and in the simplest version takes the form $V(\phi) = \Lambda^4 [1 \pm \cos(N\phi/f)]$. The model agrees with WMAP3 measurements as long as $f > 0.7 m_{Pl}$ (where $m_{Pl} = 1.22 \times 10^{19}$GeV) and $\Lambda \sim m_{GUT}$. The running of the scalar spectral index is shown to be small -- an order of magnitude below the sensitivity of WMAP3. The location of the field in the potential when perturbations on observable scales are produced is examined/ for $f > 5 m_{Pl}$, the relevant part of the potential is indistinguishable from a quadratic, yet has the advantage that the required flatness is well-motivated. Depending on the value of $f$, the model falls into the large field ($f \ge 1.5 m_{Pl}$) or small field ($f < 1.5 m_{Pl}$) classification scheme that has been applied to inflation models. Natural inflation provides a good fit to WMAP3 data.
