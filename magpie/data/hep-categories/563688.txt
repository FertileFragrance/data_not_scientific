Higher dimensional cosmological model in space-time mass (STM) theory of gravitation
A new class of non-static higher dimensional vacuum solutions in space-time -mass (STM) theory of gravity is found. This solution represent expanding universe without big bang singularity and the higher dimension of these models shrinks as they expands.
