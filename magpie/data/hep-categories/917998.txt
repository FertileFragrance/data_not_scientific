TeV sources analysis with AGILE
AGILE (Astrorivelatore Gamma a Immagini LEggero) is an Italian Space Agency (ASI) mission launched on April 23rd, 2007. The AGILE-GRID instrument onboard of the AGILE satellite is devoted to gamma-ray astrophysics in the 30 MeV - 50 GeV energy range. This paper presents the results of a systematic study performed on the first three years of AGILE-GRID data to search for GeV and sub-GeV counterparts (or derive flux upper limits) of sources detected at very high-energy by TeV experiments. Many of the TeV sources are still unidentified and deep observations at lower energies are needed to identify their possible counterparts.
