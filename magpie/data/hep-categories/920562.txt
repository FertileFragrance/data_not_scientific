Parameter Degeneracies in FNAL-Homestake LBNE Setup
LBNE (Longbaseline Neutrino Oscillation Experiments) provide a powerful experimental setup to study sensitivities and exlcusion limits in neutrino oscillation parameter space. A longbaseline experiment is being planned, at USA, from FNAL (Fermilab National Accelerator Laboratory) to an underground laboratory at Homestake in South Dakota, at an angle of 5.84 degrees from FNAL (at a distance of 1289 km). The prospect of a new beamline towards this location from FNAL, and a 300 Kiloton water Cerenkov detector at the site is in planning stage, for the studies of the neutrino physics program. The long baseline provides sufficient matter effects for neutrino travel, and a large detrecor will help towards better statistics. In this work, we present, upto what extent, the parameter degeneracies, present in oscillation parameter space, can be resolved, using this FNAL-LBNE setup.
