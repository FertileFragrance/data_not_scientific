An alternative singularity-free cosmological scenario from cusp geometries
We study an alternative geometrical approach on the problem of classical cosmological singularity. It is based on a generalized function $f (x, y) = x^{2} + y^{2} = (1 - z)z^{n}$ which consists of a cusped coupled isosurface. Such a geometry is computed and discussed into the context of Friedmann singularity-free cosmology where a pre-big bang scenario is considered. Assuming that the mechanism of cusp formation is described by non-linear oscillations of a pre-big bang extended very high energy density field ($> 3 \times 10^{94} kg/m^{3} $), we show that the action under the gravitational field follows a tautochrone of revolution, understood here as the primary projected geometry that alternatively replaces the Friedmann singularity in the standard big bang theory. As shown here this new approach allows us to interpret the nature of both matter and dark energy from first geometric principles.
