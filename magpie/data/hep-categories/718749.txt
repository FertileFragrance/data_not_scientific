Determining neutrino mass hierarchy by precision measurements in electron and muon neutrino disappearance experiments
Recently a new method for determining the neutrino mass hierarchy by comparing the effective values of the atmospheric \Delta m^2 measured in the electron neutrino disappearance channel, \Delta m^2(ee), with the one measured in the muon neutrino disappearance channel, \Delta m^2(\mu \mu), was proposed. If \Delta m^2(ee) is larger (smaller) than \Delta m^2(\mu \mu) the hierarchy is of the normal (inverted) type. We re-examine this proposition in the light of two very high precision measurements: \Delta m^2(\mu \mu) that may be accomplished by the phase II of the Tokai-to-Kamioka (T2K) experiment, for example, and \Delta m^2(ee) that can be envisaged using the novel Mossbauer enhanced resonant \bar\nu_e absorption technique. Under optimistic assumptions for the systematic uncertainties of both measurements, we estimate the parameter region of (\theta_13, \delta) in which the mass hierarchy can be determined. If \theta_13 is relatively large, sin^2 2\theta_13 \gsim 0.05, and both of \Delta m^2(ee) and \Delta m^2(\mu \mu) can be measured with the precision of \sim 0.5 % it is possible to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy at > 95% CL for 0.3 \pi \lsim \delta \lsim 1.7 \pi for the current best fit values of all the other oscillation parameters.
