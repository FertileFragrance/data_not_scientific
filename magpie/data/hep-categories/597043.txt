Vacuum plane waves in (4+1) D and exact Einstein-Maxwell solutions in (3+1) D
In this paper we derive homogeneous vacuum plane-wave solutions to Einstein's field equations in 4+1 dimensions. The solutions come in five different types of which three generalise the vacuum plane-wave solutions in 3+1 dimensions to the 4+1 dimensional case. By doing a Kaluza-Klein reduction we obtain solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell equations in 3+1 dimensions. The solutions generalise the vacuum plane-wave spacetimes of Bianchi class B to the non-vacuum case and describe spatially homogeneous spacetimes containing an extremely tilted fluid. Also, using a similar reduction we obtain 3+1 dimensional solutions to the Einstein equations with a scalar field.
