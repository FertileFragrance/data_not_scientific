Open heavy flavour and $J/\psi$ production in proton-proton collisions measured with the ALICE experiment at LHC
Open heavy flavour and J/psi production are powerful tools to test pQCD calculations in proton-proton collisions in the new LHC energy regime. In addition, they provide the necessary reference for the ALICE heavy-ion program. The ALICE experiment at the LHC collected proton-proton collisions at sqrt{s} = 7 and 2.76 TeV in 2010 and 2011. We report here the latest results of open heavy flavour and J/psi production at both mid- and forward-rapidity via their various hadronic and leptonic decay channels. These include, among other topics, the first LHC result on J/psi polarization, multiplicity dependence of the J/psi production, D-meson measurement down to low transverse momentum and J/psi production from B-hadron decays. Comparisons with different theoretical models will be discussed as well.
