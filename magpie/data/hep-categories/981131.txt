Gauge invariant quarkonium bound state equation
Path-ordered phase factors of gluon fields are used to construct gauge invariant quark Greens functions. Polygonal lines for the paths allow for a classification of the Greens functions according to the number of sides they contain. A closed set of relationships is obtained for these types of Greens function through functional relations among them. The corresponding equations of motion lead to integrodifferential equations with kernels involving Wilson loops along polygonal contours. Four-point Greens functions lead to bound state equations.
