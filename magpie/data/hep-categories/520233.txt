Lambda polarization and single spin left-right asymmetry in diffractive hadron hadron collisions
We discuss Lambda polarization and single-spin left-right asymmetry in diffractive hadron-hadron scattering at high energies. We show that the physical picture proposed in a recent Letter is consistent with the experimental observation that $\Lambda$ polarization in the diffractive process, $pp\to \Lambda K^+p$, is much higher than that in the inclusive reaction, $pp\to \Lambda X$. We make predictions for the left-right asymmetry, A_N, and for the spin transfer, $D_{NN}^\Lambda$, in the single-spin process $p(\uparrow)p\to \Lambda K^+p$ and suggest further experimental tests of the proposed picture.
