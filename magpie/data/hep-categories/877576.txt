The Complete relativistic kinetic model of symmetry violation in isotopic expanding plasma. III. Specific entropy calculation
A complete model of baryon production in an expanding, primordially symmetric hot Universe is constructed in the framework of general-relativistic kinetic theory. In this model specific model for a baryon is calculated and graphs of the value dependence are constructed.
