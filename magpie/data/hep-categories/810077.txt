Gravitational eigenstates in weak gravity II: further approximate methods for decay rates
This paper develops further approximate methods for obtaining the dipole matrix elements and corresponding transition and decay rates of the high-n, high-l gravitational eigenstates. These methods include (1) investigation of the polar spreads of the angular components of the high-n, high-l eigenstates and the effects these have on the limiting values of the angular components of the dipole matrix elements in the case of large l and m and (2) investigation of the rapid cut off and limited width of the low-p, high-n radial eigenfunctions, and the development of an equation to determine the width, position and oscillatory behaviour of those eigenfunctions in cases of arbitrarily large values of n, l and p. The methods have wider applicability than dipole transition rate estimates and may be also used to determine limits on the rates for more general interactions. Combining the methods enables the establishment of upper limits to the total dipole decay rates of many high-n, low-p states on the state diagram to be determined, even those that have many channels available for decay. The results continue to support the hypothetical existence of a specialized set of high-n, low-p gravitational eigenfunctions that are invisible and stable, both with respect to electromagnetic decay and gravitational collapse, making them excellent dark matter candidates.
