Observation of a narrow, near threshold enhancement in the p anti-p mass spectrum from radiative J / psi ---> gamma p anti-p decays
We observe a narrow enhancement near 2m_p in the invariant mass spectrum of p\bar{p} pairs from radiative J/psi-->gamma p\bar{p} decays. No similar structure is seen in J/psi-->pi0 p\bar{p} decays. The results are based on an analysis of a 58 million event sample of J/psi decays accumulated with the BESII detector at the Beijing electron-positron collider. The enhancement can be fit either with an S- or P-wave Breit Wigner resonance function: in the case of the S-wave fit, the peak mass is below 2m_p at M=1859 +3 -10(stat) +5 -25 (syst) MeV/c**2 and the total width is Gamma < 30 MeV/c**2, at the 90% confidence level. These mass and width values are not consistent with the properties of any known resonance.
