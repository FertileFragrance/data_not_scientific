Scales and phases in particle physics and cosmology
I describe and analyze the various energy scales that emerge from studying the structure of the Standard Models of particle physics and cosmology. Remarkably, save for the scale of the cosmological vacuum energy, all the scales below the Fermi scale appear to be naturally associated with generalized see-saw mechanisms. I also briefly discuss the known and presumed CP-violating phases emerging from physics associated with these models and their physical extensions. I end by commenting on the insights one might expect to gain from experiment on these issues in the next decade.
