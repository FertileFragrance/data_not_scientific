On determination of the geometric cosmological constant from the OPERA experiment of superluminal neutrinos
The recent OPERA experiment of superluminal neutrinos has deep consequences in cosmology. In cosmology a fundamental constant is the cosmological constant. From observations one can estimate the effective cosmological constant $\Lambda_{eff}$ which is the sum of the quantum zero point energy $\Lambda_{dark energy}$ and the geometric cosmological constant $\Lambda$. The OPERA experiment can be applied to determine the geometric cosmological constant $\Lambda$. It is the first time to distinguish the contributions of $\Lambda$ and $\Lambda_{dark energy}$ from each other by experiment. The determination is based on an explanation of the OPERA experiment in the framework of Special Relativity with de Sitter space-time symmetry.
