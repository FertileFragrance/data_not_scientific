Effects of a fundamental mass term in two-dimensional super Yang-Mills theory
We show that a vacuum expectation value of the perpendicular gauge boson in three-dimensional pure supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory generates mass terms for the fundamental fields, while supersymmetry stays intact. This is similar to the adjoint mass term that can be generated by a Chern-Simons term in this theory. We dimensionally reduce the theory to two dimensions, and study the spectrum as a function of the new parameter v:=< A^{\perp}> and of the Chern-Simons coupling. Apart from some symmetry issues, a straightforward picture arises. The spectrum separates into (almost) massless and very heavy states, as the couplings grow. We present structure functions and other properties of some of the bound states.
