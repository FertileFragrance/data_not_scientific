Common Origin of Active and Sterile Neutrino Masses with Dark Matter
We propose an abelian extension of the Standard Model which can explain the origin of eV scale masses and mixing for active and sterile neutrinos and at the same time providing a natural cold dark matter candidate. One of the three active neutrinos acquires mass at tree level through seesaw mechanism whereas the other two active neutrinos and one sterile neutrino acquire eV scale masses at one-loop level. The model also allows non-trivial mixing between active and sterile neutrinos at one-loop level which could have interesting signatures at neutrino experiments. After the abelian gauge symmetry gets spontaneously broken down to a $Z_2$ symmetry, the lightest $Z_2$ odd particle can naturally give rise to the cold dark matter of the Universe. The phenomenology of both fermionic and scalar dark matter is briefly discussed by incorporating latest experimental constraints.
