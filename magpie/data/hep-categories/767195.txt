Remnants of dark matter clumps
What happened to the central cores of tidally destructed dark matter clumps in the Galactic halo? We calculate the probability of surviving the remnants of dark matter clumps in the Galaxy by modelling the tidal destruction of the small-scale clumps. It is demonstrated that a substantial fraction of clump remnants may survive through the tidal destruction during the lifetime of the Galaxy if a radius of core is rather small. The resulting mass spectrum of survived clumps is extended down to the mass of the core of the cosmologically produced clumps with a minimal mass. Since annihilation signal is dominated by the dense part of the core, destruction of of the outer part of the clump affects relatively weakly annihilation rate and the survived dense remnants of tidally destructed clumps provides a large contribution to the annihilation signal in the Galaxy. The uncertainties in minimal clump mass resulting from the uncertainties in neutralino models are discussed.
