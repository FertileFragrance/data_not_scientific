Generating anisotropic fluids from vacuum Ernst equations
Starting with any stationary axisymmetric vacuum metric, we build anisotropic fluids. With the help of the Ernst method, the basic equations are derived together with the expression for the energy-momentum tensor and with the equation of state compatible with the field equations. The method is presented by using different coordinate systems: the cylindrical coordinates $\rho, z$ and the oblate spheroidal ones. A class of interior solutions matching with stationary axisymmetric asymptotically flat vacuum solutions is found in oblate spheroidal coordinates. The solutions presented satisfy the three energy conditions.
