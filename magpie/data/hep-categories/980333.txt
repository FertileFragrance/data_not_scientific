A Landscape in Boundary String Field Theory: New Class of Solutions with Massive State Condensation
We solve the equation of motion of boundary string field theory allowing generic boundary operators quadratic in $X$, and explore string theory non-perturbative vacua with massive state condensation. Using numerical analysis, a large number of new solutions are found. Their energies turn out to distribute densely in the range between the D-brane tension and the energy of the tachyon vacuum. We discuss an interpretation of these solutions as perturbative closed string states. From the cosmological point of view, the distribution of the energies can be regarded as the so-called landscape of string theory, as we have a vast number of non-perturbative string theory solutions including one with small vacuum energy.
