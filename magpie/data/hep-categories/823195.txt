Anomalous resonant production of the fourth family up type quarks at the LHC
Considering the present limits on the masses of fourth family quarks from the Tevatron experiments, the fourth family quarks are expected to have mass larger than the top quark. Due to their expected large mass they could have different dynamics than the quarks of three families of the Standard Model. The resonant production of the fourth family up type quark t' has been studied via anomalous production subprocess gq_i-->t' (where q_i=u,c) at the LHC with the center of mass energy 10 TeV and 14 TeV. The signatures of such process are discussed within the SM decay modes. The sensitivity to anomalous coupling \kappa/\Lambda=0.1 TeV^(-1) can be reached at \sqrt{s}=10 TeV^(-1) and L_int=100 pb^(-1).
