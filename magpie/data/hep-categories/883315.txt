Scaling violation and the inelasticity of very high energy protonâ€“proton interactions
The pseudorapidity measurements at LHC, although in the central region only, allows to perform preliminary tests of the multiparticle production extrapolation formula inspired by the recent cosmic ray data analysis. Feynman scaling violation in the form proposed originally by Wdowczyk and Wolfendale in 70s has been applied to the Pierre Auger Observatory and the Hi-Res group measurements. The consistency of the Extensive Air Shower development and anisotropy data was found for smoothly rise of the scaling violation parameter. We have shown that the longitudinal momenta of produced particles determined inclusively as rapidity (pseudorapidity) distributions measured by LHC experiments follow the some universal high energy distribution scaled respectively. The high degree of Feynman scaling violation is confirmed. The decrease of the very high energy interaction inelasticity suggested by cosmic ray data analysis is found to be consistent with LHC measurements up to 7 TeV.
