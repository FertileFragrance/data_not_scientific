A Transfer Matrix Method for Resonances in Randall-Sundrum Models III: An analytical comparison
The transfer matrix method is used to analyze resonances in Randall-Sundrum models. Although it has successfully been used previously by us we provide here a comparison between the numerical and analytical models. To reach this we first find new exact solution for the scalar, gauge, Kalb-Ramond and $q-$form fields. Them we calculate numerically the resonances by the transfer matrix method and compare with the analytical result. For completeness, this is done for models with and without the dilaton coupling. The results show a perfect agreement between the analytical and numerical methods.
