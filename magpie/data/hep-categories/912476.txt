Metastable Supertubes and non-extremal Black Hole Microstates
We study the dynamics of supertubes in smooth bubbling geometries with three charges and three dipole charges that can describe black holes, black rings and their microstates. We find the supertube Hamiltonian in these backgrounds and show that there exist metastable supertube configurations, that can decay into supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric ones via brane-flux annihilation. We also find stable non-supersymmetric configurations. Both the metastable and the stable non-supersymmetric configuration are expected to describe microstate geometries for non-extremal black holes, and we discuss the implication of their existence for the fuzzball proposal.
