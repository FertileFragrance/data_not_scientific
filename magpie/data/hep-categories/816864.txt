A Quantizable Model of Massive Gauge Vector Bosons without Higgs
We incorporate the parameters of the gauge group G into the gauge theory of interactions through a non-linear partial-trace sigma-model Lagrangian on G/H. The minimal coupling of the new (Goldstone-like) scalar bosons provides mass terms to those intermediate vector bosons associated with the quotient G/H, without spoiling gauge invariance, remaining the H-vector potentials massless. The main virtue of a partial trace on G/H, rather than on the entire G, is that we can find an infinite-dimensional symmetry, with non-trivial Noether invariants, which ensures quantum integrability in a non-canonical quantization scheme. The present formalism is explicitly applied to the case G=SU(2)x U(1), as a Higgs-less alternative to the Standard Model of electroweak interactions, although it can also be used in low-energy phenomenological models for strong interactions.
