Analytical investigation of the phase transition between holographic insulator and superconductor in Gauss-Bonnet gravity
We employ the variational method for the Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem to analytically study the phase transition between the holographic insulator and superconductor in the Gauss-Bonnet gravity. By investigating the s-wave and p-wave holographic insulator/superconductor models, we find that this analytic method is more effective to obtain the analytic results on the condensation and the critical phenomena in the AdS soliton background in Gauss-Bonnet gravity. Our analytic result can be used to back up the numerical computations in the AdS soliton with Gauss-Bonnet correction.
