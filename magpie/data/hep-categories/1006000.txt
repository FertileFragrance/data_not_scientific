Holographic entanglement plateaux
We consider the entanglement entropy for holographic field theories in finite volume. We show that the Araki-Lieb inequality is saturated for large enough subregions, implying that the thermal entropy can be recovered from the knowledge of the region and its complement. We observe that this actually is forced upon us in holographic settings due to non-trivial features of the causal wedges associated with a given boundary region. In the process, we present an infinite set of extremal surfaces in Schwarzschild-AdS geometry anchored on a given entangling surface. We also offer some speculations regarding the homology constraint required for computing holographic entanglement entropy.
