Analytical evolution of nucleon structure functions with power corrections at twist-4 and predictions for ultra-high energy neutrino-nucleon cross section
In this paper we present an analytic result for the evolution in $Q^2$ of the structure functions for the neutrino-nucleon interaction, valid at twist-2 in the region of small values of the Bjorken $x$ variable and for soft non-perturbative input. In the special case of flat initial conditions, we include in the calculation also the contribution of the twist-4 gluon recombination corrections, whose effect in the evolution is explicitly determined. Finally, we estimate the resulting charged-current neutrino-nucleon total cross section and discuss its behavior at ultra-high energies.
