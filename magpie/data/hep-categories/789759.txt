On the interaction between two Kerr black holes
The double-Kerr solution is generated using both a Backlund transformation and the Belinskii-Zakharov inverse-scattering technique. We build a dictionary between the parametrisations naturally obtained in the two methods and show their equivalence. We then focus on the asymptotically flat double-Kerr system obeying the axis condition which is Z_2^\phi invariant. We 1) provide an exact formula for the force between the two black holes, in terms of their physical quantities and the coordinate distance/ 2) show that the angular velocity of the two black holes decreases from the usual Kerr value at infinite distance to zero in the touching limit/ 3) show that the extremal limit of the two black holes is given by |J|=cM^2, where c depends on the distance and varies from one to infinity as the distance decreases/ 4) show that for sufficiently large angular momentum the temperature of the black holes attains a maximum at a certain finite coordinate distance. All of these results are interpreted in terms of the dragging effects of the system. We provide an explicit metric for the asymptotically flat, Z_2^\phi invariant, extremal, double Kerr system obeying the axis condition.
