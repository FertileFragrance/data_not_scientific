The standard model physical degrees of freedom interpretation of the electromagnetic fine structure coupling alpha(0) approx. 1/137
The present short note gives for the first time a derivation of the inverse electromagnetic fine structure constant from the elementary particles content of the standard model plus graviton and the Higgs. It is the first derivation ever to interpr et alpha o = 137 as the familiar N(f) = (2)(48) = 96 Fermions and N(B) = (2)(15) = 30 Bosons of the standard model plus the eleven dimensions D = 11 of super gravity spacetime N f + N B + D = alpha o . The exact theoretical value 137.082039325 and t he accurate experimental results are also given clear mathematical derivation showing that all of the 137 and not only the 96 + 30 = 126 may be interpreted as physical particles so that in a sense elementary particles create and span spacetime.
