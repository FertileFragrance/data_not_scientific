BPS states carrying fermionic brane charges
The Green-Siegel central extension of superalgebras for BPS branes is studied. In these cases commutators of usual bosonic brane charges only with the broken supersymmetry charges allow this central extension. We present an interpretation of these fermionic central charges as fermionic brane charges, and show that they take nonzero values for a nontrivial fermionic boundary condition. Such fermionic coordinates solutions are determined by equations of motion in a suitable gauge condition which manifests Nambu-Goldstone fermionic modes as well as bosonic modes in the static gauge. We also show that some modes of dilatino fields couple with the fermionic brane currents.
