On Noncommutative Corrections of Gravitational Energy in Teleparallel Gravity
We use the theory of teleparallelism equivalent to general relativity based on noncommutative spacetime coordinates. In this context, we write the corrections of the Schwarzschild solution. We propose the existence of a Weitzenbo<ck spacetime that matches the corrected metric tensor. As an important result, we find the corrections of the gravitational energy in the realm of teleparallel gravity due to the noncommutativity of spacetime. Then we interpret such corrections as a manifestation of quantum theory in gravitational field.
