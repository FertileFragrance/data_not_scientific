Impact of CFL quark matter on the cooling of compact stars
The cooling mechanism of compact stars with quark cores in the color-flavor locked phase is discussed. It is argued that the high thermal conductivity of the quark core plays a key role in the stellar cooling. It implies that the cooling time of compact stars with color-flavor locked quark cores is similar to that of ordinary neutron stars, unless the star is almost completely made of color-flavor locked quark matter.
