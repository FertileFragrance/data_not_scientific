Non-Gaussianity in String Cosmology: A Case Study
We study non-gaussianity effects, using the $\delta N$ formalism, in a multi-field inflationary model consisting of K\'ahler moduli derived from type IIB string compactification in the large volume limit. The analytical work in this paper mostly follows the separable potential method developed by Vernizzi and Wands. The numerical analysis is then used in computing non-gaussianity beyond slow-roll regime. The possibility of the curvaton scenario is also discussed. We give the condition for the existence of the curvaton and calculate the non-guassianity generated by the curvaton decay in the large volume limit.
