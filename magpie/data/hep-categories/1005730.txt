Gluonic Effects on g-2: Holographic View
We study "gluonic effects" (gluon condensation effects) on the hadronic leading order (HLO) contributions to the anomalous magnetic moment (g-2) of leptons, based on a holographic model having explicit gluonic mode introduced for consistency with the operator product expansion of QCD. We find gluonic enhancement of HLO contributions to the muon g-2 by about 6%, which nicely fills in the gap between the holographic estimate without gluonic effects and the phenomenological one using the experimental data as inputs. Similar calculations including the gluonic effects for the electron and the tau lepton g-2 are also carried out in good agreement with the phenomenological estimates. We then apply our holographic estimate to the Walking Technicolor (WTC) where large techni-gluonic effects were shown to be vital for the Technidilaton, (pseudo) Nambu-Goldstone boson of the (approximate) scale symmetry of WTC, to be naturally as light as 125 GeV. It is shown that the value of the techni-HLO contributions to the muon g-2 is 10-100 times enhanced by inclusion of the same amount of the gluonic effects as that realizing the 125 GeV Technidilaton, although such an enhanced techni-HLO contribution is still negligibly small compared with the current deviation of the Standard Model prediction of the muon g-2 from the experiments. The techni-HLO contributions to the tau lepton g-2 is also discussed, suggesting a possible phenomenological relevance to be tested by the future experiments.
