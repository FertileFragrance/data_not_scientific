Quarkonium Binding and Entropic Force
A $Q{\bar{Q}}$ bound state represents a balance between repulsive kinetic and attractive potential energy. In a hot quarkâ€“gluon plasma, the interaction potential experiences medium effects. Color screening modifies the attractive binding force between the quarks, while the increase of entropy with $Q{\bar{Q}}$ separation gives rise to a growing repulsion. We study the role of these phenomena for in-medium $Q{\bar{Q}}$ binding and dissociation. It is found that the relevant potential for $Q{\bar{Q}}$ binding is the free energy $F$ , with increasing $Q{\bar{Q}}$ separation, further binding through the internal energy $U$ is compensated by repulsive entropic effects.
