Combined CDF and D0 Upper Limits on Standard Model Higgs-Boson Production with up to 2.4 fb$^{-1}$ of data
We combine results from CDF and D0 searches for a standard model Higgs boson in ppbar collisions at the Fermilab Tevatron at sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV. With 1.0-2.4 fb-1 of data collected at CDF, and 1.1-2.3 fb-1 at D0, the 95 % C.L. upper limits on Higgs boson production are a factor of 3.7 (1.1) higher than the SM cross section for a Higgs boson mass of m_{H}=115 (160) GeV. Based on simulation, the median expected upper limit should be 3.3 (1.6). Standard Model branching ratios, calculated as functions of the Higgs boson mass, are assumed. Compared to the previous Higgs Tevatron combination, more data and new channels (H -> gamma gamma, and $H -> tau tau produced in several modes) have been added. Existing channels, such as both experiments' ZH -> nu nu b b channels, have been reanalyzed to gain sensitivity. These results extend significantly the individual limits of each experiment.
