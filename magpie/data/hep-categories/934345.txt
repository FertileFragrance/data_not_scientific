Entanglement arrow of time in the multiverse
In this paper it is presented the model of a multiverse made up of entangled pairs of universes. The arrow of time obtained from the principles of thermodynamics and the arrow of time given by the thermodynamics of entanglement for single universes are analyzed. The latter requires that the single universes expand once they have crossed the quantum barrier at the Euclidean regime. The possible relationship with respect to the grow of local structures in a single universe is also discussed.
