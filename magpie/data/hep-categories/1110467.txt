Bouncing universe with modified dispersion relation
In this paper, employing the modified dispersion relation, we derive out the modified Friedmann equations for the FRW Universe with the non-vanishing values of the spatial curvature $k$. In this setup, we find that taking different values of $k$ in the FRW Universe can sufficiently affect the energy scale of the bouncing solutions happening. In contrast to the previous work with $k=0$, we have mainly demonstrated that the bouncing solution for the closed Universe with $k=1$ appears at the normal energy limit of the modified dispersion relation introduced, which means that when bouncing phenomenon is in presence, its entropy is just zero. Surprisingly, when $k=-1$, the bouncing solution is in absence.
