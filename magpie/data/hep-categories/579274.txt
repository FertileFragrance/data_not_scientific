Photon colliders in physical program for large colliders
In this report our main attention is focused on the problems which can be solved at Photon Colliders naturally but are hardly solved at LHC and e^+e^- Linear Collider: The New Physics - new particles, new interactions, supersymmetry, Dirac monopole, extra dimensions... SM and the case of a SM--like scenario - EWSB, Higgs bosons, anomalies in interactions of gauge bosons, QCD, Pomeron and odderon... By-product: Production of light Goldstone particles from region of e\to\gamma conversion.
