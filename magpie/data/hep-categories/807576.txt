Electromagnetic properties for arbitrary spin particles: Natural electromagnetic moments from light-cone arguments
In a set of two papers, we propose to study an old-standing problem, namely the electromagnetic interaction for particles of arbitrary spin. Based on the assumption that light-cone helicity at tree level and $Q^2=0$ should be conserved non-trivially by the electromagnetic interaction, we are able to derive \emph{all} the natural electromagnetic moments for a pointlike particle of \emph{any} spin. In this second paper, we give explicit expressions for the light-cone helicity amplitudes in terms of covariant vertex functions, leading to the natural electromagnetic moments at $Q^2=0$. As an application of our results, we generalize the discussion of quark transverse charge densities to particles with arbitrary spin.
