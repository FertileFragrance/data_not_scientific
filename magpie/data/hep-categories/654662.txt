Generation-changing interaction of sneutrinos in e+ e- collisions
Measurability of generation mixing is studied on the pair production of sneutrinos in $e^+e^-$ collisions and their subsequent decays into two different charged leptons $e$ and $\mu$ with two lighter charginos. The analyses are made systematically in a general framework of the supersymmetric extension of the standard model. The production and decay process depends on the parameters of the chargino sector, as well as those of the sneutrino sector. Although generation-changing interactions are severely constrained by radiative charged-lepton decays, sizable regions in the parameter space could still be explored at $e^+e^-$ colliders in near future.
