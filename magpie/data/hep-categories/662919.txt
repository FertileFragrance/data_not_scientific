Analysis of $B_d^0 \to \phi K^{*0}$ decay mode with supersymmetry
Motivated by the recent measurement of low longitudinal polarization fraction in the decay mode $\B \to \phi K^{*0}$, which appears not to be in agreement with the standard model expectation, we analyze this mode in the minimal supersymmetric standard model with mass insertion approximation. Within the standard model, with factorization approximation, the longitudinal polarization is expected to be $f_L \sim 1-{\cal O}(1/m_b^2)$. We find that this anomaly can be explained in the minimal supersymmetric standard model with either $LR$ or $RL$ mass insertion approximation.
