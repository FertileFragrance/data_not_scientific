Vacuum Stability Constraints on the Enhancement of the h --> gamma gamma rate in the MSSm
The ATLAS and CMS collaborations discovered a new boson particle. If the new boson is the Higgs boson, the diphoton signal strength is 1.5 - 1.8 times larger than the Standard Model (SM) prediction, while the WW and ZZ signal strengths are in agreement with the SM one. In the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), overall consistency can be achieved by a light stau and the large left-right mixing of staus. However, a light stau and large left-right mixing of staus may suffer from vacuum instability. We first apply the vacuum meta-stability condition to the Higgs to diphoton decay rate in the MSSM. We show that the vacuum meta-stablity severely constrains the enhancement to the Higgs to diphoton rate. For example, when the lighter stau mass is 100 GeV, the upper bound on the enhancement to the Higgs to diphoton rate becomes 25%.
