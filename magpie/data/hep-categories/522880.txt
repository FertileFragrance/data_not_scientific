The Multiply scattering effect on the energy measurement of UHE cosmic rays using atmospheric fluorescence technique
Point sources in the atmosphere are surrounded by aureole because of atmospheric scattering. The properties of the time-dependent aureole radiance are calculated by use of a Monte Carlo approach and an iterative method. Since the aureole is particularly important in the ultraviolet, which is the region the Ultra-High-Energy (UHE) cosmic ray experiment using the air fluorescence technique like Fly's Eye or High-Resolution-Fly's-Eye(HiRes) are set in. The effect of the multiply scatteing on the energy measurement is studied.
