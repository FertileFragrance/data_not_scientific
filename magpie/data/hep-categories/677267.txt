Measurement of time-dependent CP-violating asymmetries and constraints on $\sin(2\beta+\gamma)$ with partial reconstruction of $B \to D^{*\mp} \pi^\pm$ decays
We present a measurement of the time-dependent CP-violating asymmetries in decays of neutral B mesons to the final states D*-+ pi+-, using approximately 232 million BBbar events recorded by the BABAR experiment at the PEP2 e+e- storage ring. Events containing these decays are selected with a partial reconstruction technique, in which only the high-momentum pi+- from the B decay and the low-momentum pi-+ from the D*-+ decay are used. % We measure the parameters related to 2beta+gamma to be a_D*pi=-0.034 +- 0.014 +- 0.009 and c_l_D*pi = -0.019 +- 0.022 +- 0.013. With some theoretical assumptions, we interpret our results in term of the lower limits |\sin(2beta+gamma)|> 0.62 (0.35) at 68% (90%) confidence level.
