Higgs quark couplings in SUSY with CP and flavor violations
In minimal supersymmetric model with a light Higgs sector, explicit CP violation and most general flavor mixings in the sfermion sector, integration of the superpartners out of the spectrum induces potentially large contributions to the Yukawa couplings of light quarks via those of the heavier ones. These corrections can be sizeable even for moderate values of tan(beta), and remain nonvanishing even if all superpartners decouple. Then Higgs boson couplings to light quarks assume spectacular enhancements: in particular, couplings to down and strange quarks become degenerate with that to the bottom quark. There arise strikingly non-standard effects that can show up in both Higgs boson searches and FCNC observables.
